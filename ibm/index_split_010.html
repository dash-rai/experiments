<p class="calibre1">system </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulators  varied  from  camp  to  camp  and  from  year  to  year,  depending </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  camps,  such  as  Dachau  and  Storkow,  as  many  as  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">dozen  IBM  sorters,  tabulators,  and  printers  were  installed.1  Other </p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities  operated  punches  only  and  submitted  their  cards  to  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tral  locations  such  as  Mauthausen  or  Berlin;  in  some  camps,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">plain  paper  forms  were  coded  and  processed  elsewhere.2  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">activity—whether  paper,  punching,  or  processing,  was  frequendy  lo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cated  within  the  camp  itself,  consigned  to  a  special  bureau  called </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Labor  Assignment  Office,  known  in  German  as  the  Arbeitsein- </p>
<p class="calibre1">satz.3  The  Arbeitseinsatz  issued  the  all-important  daily  work  assign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments,  and  processed  all  inmate  cards  and  labor  transfer  rosters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  necessitated  a  constant  traffic  of  lists,  punch  cards,  and  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">codeable  documents  as  every  step  of  the  prisoner's  existence  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">regimented and tracked.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  Reich  established  camps  all  over  Europe,  but  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  all  alike.  Some,  such  as  Flossenburg  in  Germany,  were  labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">camps  where  inmates  were  worked  to  death.  Several,  such  as  Wester- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bork in Holland, were transit camps, that is, staging sites en route to </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  destinations.  A  number  of  camps,  such  as  Treblinka  in  Poland,  were  op- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erated  for  the  Hole  purpose  of  immediate  extermination  by  gas  chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some camps, such as Auschwitz, combined elements of all three.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  IBM's  machinery,  continuing  upkeep  and  service,  as  well  as  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">supply  of  punch  cards,  whether  located  on-site  or  off-site,  Hitler's  camps </p>
<p class="calibre1">could have never managed the numbers they did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  major  camps  were  assigned  Hollerith  code  numbers  for  their  paper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">work: Auschwitz . . . 001; Buchenwald . . . 002; Dachau . . . 003; Flossenburg </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  ..  004;  Gross-Rosen  .  .  .  005;  Herzogenbusch  .  .  .  006;  Mauthausen  ...007; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natzweiler  .  .  .  008;  Neuengamme  .  .  .  009;  Ravensbruck  .  .  .  010;  Sachsen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hausen ... 011; Stutthof... 012.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz,  coded  001,  was  not  a  single  camp,  but  a  sprawling  complex, </p>
<p class="calibre1">comprised  of  transit  facilities,  slave  factories  and  farms,  gas  chambers,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">crematoria.  In  most  camps,  the  Arbeitseinsatz  tabulated  not  only  work  assign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments,  but  also the camp  hospital  index  and  the  general death  and  inmate  sta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tistics  for  the  Political  Section.  But  at  Auschwitz,  paper  data  was  probably </p>
<p class="calibre1">shipped off-site, perhaps to another camp, such as Mathausen, for processing.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  August  1943,  a  timber  merchant  from  Bendzin,  Poland,  arrived  among </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  group  of  400  inmates,  mostly  Jews.  First,  a  doctor  examined  him  briefly  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">determine  his  fitness  for  work.  His  physical  information  was  noted  on  a  med- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ical  record  for  the  "camp  hospital  index."  Second,  his  full  prisoner  registra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  was  completed  with  all  personal  details.  Third,  his  name  was  checked </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  the  indices  of  the  Political  Section  to  see  if  he  would  be  subjected  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  cruelty.  Finally,  he  was  registered  by  Hollerith  method  in  the  labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">index  for  the  Arbeitseinsatz  and  assigned  a  characteristic  five-digit  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">number,  44673.8  This  five-digit  number  would  follow  the  Polish  merchant </p>
<p class="calibre1">from labor assignment to assignment as Hollerith systems tracked him and his </p>
<p class="calibre1">availability  for  work,  and  reported  it  to  the  central  inmate  file  kept  at  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  DII.  Department  DII  of  the  SS  Economics  Administration  in  Oranien- </p>
<p class="calibre1">burg oversaw all camp slave labor assignments.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later  in  the  summer  of  1943,  the  timber  merchant's  same  five-digit </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  number,  44673,  was  tattooed  on  his  forearm.  Eventually,  during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the summer of 1943, all non-Germans at Auschwitz were similarly tattooed.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tattoos,  however,  quickly  evolved  at  Auschwitz.  Soon,  they  bore  no  fur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther  relation  to  Hollerith  compatibility  for  one  reason:  the  Hollerith  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  designed  to  track  a  working  inmate—not  a  dead  one.  Once  the  daily </p>
<p class="calibre1">death  rate  at  Auschwitz  climbed,  Hollerith-based  numbering  simply  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">outmoded. Clothes  would be  quickly removed from  any  cadaver,  making iden- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tification for the Hollerith-maintained death lists difficult. So camp numbers </p>
<p class="calibre1">were inked onto a prisoner's chest. But as th e  chest became obscured amidst </p>
<p class="calibre1">growing  mounds  of  dead  bodies,  the  forearm  was  preferred  as  a  more  visible </p>
<p class="calibre1">appendage.  Soon,  ad  hoc  numbering  systems  were  inaugurated  at  Auschwitz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Various  number ranges,  often  with  letters  attached,  were assigned to  prisoners </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  ascending  sequence.  Dr.  Josef  Mengele,  who  performed  bizarre  experi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments,  tattooed  his  own  distinct  number  series  on  patients.  Tattoo  numbering </p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimately  took  on  a  chaotic  incongruity  all  its  own  as  an  internal  Auschwitz- </p>
<p class="calibre1">specific identification system.11. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Hollerith  numbers  remained  the  chief  method  Berlin  employed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">centrally identify and track prisoners at Auschwitz. For example, in late 1943, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  6,500  healthy,  working  Jews  were  ordered  to  the  gas  chamber  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS.  But  their  murder  was delayed  for  two  days  as  the  Political  Section  metic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulously  checked  each  of  their  numbers  against  the  Section's  own  card  index. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Section  was  under  orders  to  temporarily  reprieve  any  Jews  with  traces </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Aryan parentage.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sigismund  Gajda  was  processed  by  the  three-step  Hollerith  system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born  in  Kielce,  Poland,  Gajda  was  about  forty  years  of  age  when on  May  18, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1943, he arrived at Auschwitz. A paper form, labeled "Personal Inmate Card," </p>
<p class="calibre1">recorded  all  of  Gajda's  personal  information.  He  professed  Roman  Catho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">licism,  had  two  children,  and  his  work  skill  was  marked  "mechanic."  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">reverse  side  of  his  Personal  Inmate  Card  listed  nine  previous  work  assign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments. At the bottom of the card's front panel was a column to list any physi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal  punishments  meted  out,  such  as  flogging,  tree-binding,  or  beating.  Once </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gajda's card  was  processed,  a  large  indicia in typical Nazi  Gothic script letters </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  rubber-stamped  at  the  bottom:  Hollerith  erfasst,  or  "Hollerith  registered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  designation  was  stamped  in  large  letters  on  hundreds  of  thousands  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">processed Personal Inmate Cards at camps all across Europe.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz's  print  shops  produced  the  empty  plain  paper  Personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inmate  Cards  for  Hollerith  operations  at  most  other  concentration  camps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  the  Auschwitz  presses  simply  could  not  keep  up  with  demand.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  instance,  on  October  14,  1944,  the  leader  of  Ravensbriick's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  sent  a  letter  to  his  counterpart  at  Flossenburg's  Hollerith  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  confirming  that  a  work  gang  of  200  females  had  been  dispatched  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">slave  labor  at  the  Witt  Company  in  Helmbrechts.  "The  inmates'  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  as  well  as  the  Hollerith  transfer  lists  are  being  submitted,"  the  Ravens- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bruck  officer  leader  wrote.  But,  he  added,  "Since  at  the  moment,  no  [Inmate] </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cards  can  be  obtained  from  the  Auschwitz  printers,  temporary  cards  had  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be made for that part of the transport."14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">All Auschwitz inmate information, including workers still alive, deaths, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  transferees,  was  continuously  punched  into  the  Hollerith  system  servic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  camp.  Tabulated  totals  were  wired  each  day  to  the  SS  Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">A d mi n i st r at i o n  and  other  offices  in    Berlin  by  the  various  camp  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Departments.  Hollerith  tracking  was  the  only  system  for  monitoring  the  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly shifting total population of all camps.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  "Central  Inmate  File"  at  the  SS  Economics  Administration  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">mere  paper  file,  but  all  its  information  was  punched  into  the  central  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">banks  in  Berlin  and  Oranienburg.  Each  prisoner  was  tracked  with  a  single </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper  card  boldly  labeled  at  the  top  Haftlingskarte,  that  is,  "Inmate  Card." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  paper  card  was  filled  with  personal  information  handwritten  in  fields </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  to  the  corresponding  Hollerith  code  numbers  to  be  punched  into  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment.  No  names  were  used  to  identify  prisoners  in  this  file—only  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">assigned  Hollerith  numbers,  generally  five  digits  long,  but  often  six  digits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each  five-  or  six-digit  number  was  coupled  with  a  concentration  camp  num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber. Hence, each camp could potentially register 999,999 inmates.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance,  one  nameless  inmate  was  assigned  the  six-digit  number, </p>
<p class="calibre1">057949, which was to be punched into columns 22 and 27 of a Hollerith card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was born on October 7, 1907, which was punched into section 5. The Secu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rity Police, which was coded 1 for column 2, took the man into custody in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">town  of  Metz,  which  was  punched  into  a  different  row.  November  11,  1943, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  arrest  date,  which  was  punched  into  section  3.  Prisoner  057949  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">marked as a Communist Spaniard, coded 6 for column 4. As a male, box 1 for </p>
<p class="calibre1">column  6  was  checked;  but  since  he  was  unmarried,  box  1  for  column  7  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">also checked; his one child necessitated an additional mark for column 8. Pris- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oner 057949 was transferred to Dachau, coded "03" for columns 21 and 26.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along  the  bottom  of  Prisoner  057949's  card  was  a  series  of  lines  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">each concentration camp to which he was assigned. At the right of each camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">entry  line  was  a  grid  marked  Holl.  Verm.  for  "Hollerith  Notation"  above  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">separates boxes: one marked "In," and the next marked "Out."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  bottom  right  of  every  Inmate  Card  was  a  special  processing  sec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion labeled Kontrollvermerk. Under Kontrollvermerk were three boxes: </p>
<p class="calibre1">ausgestellt for "issued" </p>
<p class="calibre1">verschlusselt for "encoded" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lochk. gepruft for "punch card verified."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  punch  card  operator's  number  was  hand-stamped  in  the  "punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  verified"  box  to  maintain  quality  control.20  Millions  of  identical  Inmate </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cards  were  run  through  the  system,  all  featuring  column-numbered  data </p>
<p class="calibre1">fields, the distinctive "Hollerith Notation" grid, and control boxes to certify </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  punch  card  processing  details.  When  a  number  holder  deceased,  Ins </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  was  simply  re-issued.  Of  the  millions  produced,  more  than  a  hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dred thousand such Inmate Cards survived the war.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  tracking  worked  so  well  that  the  SS  Economics  Administra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  was  able  to  authoritatively  challenge  the  slave  labor  reports  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving  on  any  given  day.  For  instance,  at  one  point  in  the  latter  part  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1943,  the  central  office  asked  for  the  number  of  Auschwitz  Jews  fit  for  reas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">signment  to  an  armaments  plant.  On  August  29,  Auschwitz  replied  that  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">3,581  were  available.  Senior  SS  Economics  Administration  Officer  Gerhard </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maurer  knew  from  DII's  Hollerith  sorts  that  fully  25,000  Jews  were  available </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  work  transfers.  Four  days  later,  Maurer  dispatched  a  brash  rejoinder  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz  Camp  Commandant  Rudolf  Hoess  himself.  "What  are  the  remain- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  21,500  Jews  doing?"  Maurer  demanded.  "Something's  amiss  here!  Please </p>
<p class="calibre1">again scrutinize this process and give a report."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  in  January  1945,  a  number  of  Russian  prisoners  were  delivered </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Auschwitz.  Each  of  them  was  classed  Nacht  und  Nebel,  which  translated  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Night  and  Fog,"  essentially  designating  them  as  covert  inmates.  Nacht  und </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nebel Russians were coded 14 in Auschwitz records.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Departments  at  camps  could  not  be  operated  by  miscellaneous </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor  whether  they  used  mere  coded  paper  forms,  cards,  or  actual  machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  required so-called  Hollerith experts  trained  by an  IBM  subsidiary,  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  in  Germany,  or  any  of  the  others  depending  upon  location.  At </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz,  the  key  man  running  the  card  index  systems  was  Eduard  Muller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muller was a fat, aging, ill-kempt man, with brown hair and brown eyes. Some </p>
<p class="calibre1">said,  "He  stank  like  a  polecat."  A  rabid  Nazi,  Muller  took  special  delight  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">harming inmates from his all-important position in camp administration.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buchenwald,  coded  002,  was  established  in  July  1937,  long  before  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  started.  From  its  inception,  Buchenwald  was  a  cruel  destiny  for  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's  social  undesirables,  including  politicals,  hardened  criminals,  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">work-shy  misfits,  Jehovah's  Witnesses,  homosexuals,  and  Jews.  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  were  needed  from  the  outset  to  code  and  segregate  each  type  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">inmate,  and  then  ensure  the  prisoner  was  subjected  to  a  regimen  of  maltreat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment and deprivation prescribed for his category.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  when  many  Jews,  homosexuals,  and  Jehovah's  Witnesses  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istered  at  Buchenwald,  they  were  required  to  write  "career  criminal"  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">front  of  their  Personal  Inmate  Card  as  a  welcoming  humiliation  ritual.  Their </p>
<p class="calibre1">real  occupation  was  noted  on  the  back.  Those  who  balked  at  fisting  them- </p>
<p class="calibre1">selves as criminals were severely beaten.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So many hundreds of thousands of IBM cards, all with the characteris- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tic  red  Dehomag  logo  printed  along  the  edge  clicked  through  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  of  Buchenwald,  and  its  many  sub-camps,  that  spent  cards  were  typ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ically  cut  in  half  so  the  backs  could  be  used  for  note  pads.  For  example,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">flip  side  of  a  punch  card  recording  production  details  at  the  Zwieberge  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp  was  re-used  to  request  shift  assignments.  The  commander  scribbled  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  back:  please  deploy  Alfred  and  Schneider  to  Kommando  1.  "They  are  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be transferred to a shift... in Block 12."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deaths  were  so  numerous  at  Buchenwald  that  the  hospital  staff  jotted </p>
<p class="calibre1">individual  details  on  the  back  of  used  IBM  cards.  Typically,  the  deceased  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mate's  five-  or  six-digit  number,  sometimes  with  barracks  number  appended, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was scrawled next to the name and nationality, next to two dates: entry into the </p>
<p class="calibre1">hospital  and  death.  German  Prisoner  52234  entered  April  11  and  died  April </p>
<p class="calibre1">12. French prisoner 71985 entered on April 14 and exited on April 15. French </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  prisoner  93190  entered  April  14  and  departed  two  days  later.  A  tell- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tale array of hole punches was always clearly visible on these square scraps.28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dachau,  coded  003,  was  the  Reich's  first  organized  concentration  camp, </p>
<p class="calibre1">established  in  March  1933  in  the  first  weeks  of  the  Hitler  regime.  Several </p>
<p class="calibre1">detention  camps  had  been  erected  early  on.  But  Dachau,  set  up  just  ten  kilo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">meters  from  Munich,  was  the  first  Nazi  camp  created  to  inflict  hellish  cruelty </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  Reich's  undesirables,  especially  Communists  and  Jews.  Offices  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">merciless  Waffen-SS  and  its  predecessor  organizations,  located  at  Dachau, </p>
<p class="calibre1">utilized  at  least  four  multi-machine  sets  of  IBM  machines,  including  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag's most advanced. Waffen-SS units were militarized SS troops that actively </p>
<p class="calibre1">participated in some of the bloodiest murders of the war.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Dachau  was  originally  established  for  Germans,  once  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">conquered  Europe,  inmates  from  many  countries  were  processed  through  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  machines.  Middle-class  Parisian  prisoners  were  in  abundance.  Pris- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oner  072851,  a  French  salesman,  was  taken  by  the  Security  Police  in  Paris; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  operator  number  8  processed  his  card.  Prisoner  072850,  a  chef, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  also  taken  by  the  Security  Police  in  Paris;  Hollerith  operator  number  8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  processed  his  card.  Prisoner  072833  was  a  gardener,  taken  by  Security </p>
<p class="calibre1">Police  in  Paris;  Hollerith  operator  8  punched  his  information  as  well.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  next  card  in  the  sequence  belonged  to  Prisoner  072834,  a  baker  taken </p>
<p class="calibre1">by Security Police in Paris; that card was punched by Hollerith operator 9.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dachau's  equipment  was  managed  by  several  Hollerith  experts  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">non-technical  supervisors.  Albert  Bartels,  head  of  the  SS  machine  record </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency,  with  no  particular  expertise,  functioned  as  the  senior  official.  Herbert </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blaettel  possessed  the  technical  knowledge  since  he  was  a  former  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">dealer and later worked in Dehomag's training department. Blaettel was aided </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Heiber,  considered  a  virulent  SS  man.  Busch,  another  technical  expert, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  a  Dehomag  dealer  since  1932  and  finally  joined  the  SS  in  1943  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">help  the  SS  operate  its  machines.  Because  Dachau  was  just  ten  kilometers </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Willy  Heidinger's  hometown  near  Munich,  and  the  well-established </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  branch  office  there,  Dachau  was  always  close  to  the  epicenter  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  automation  development.  For  example,  Dachau  received  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag's very first advanced alphabetizer, the DII-A.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flossenburg, coded 004, was another camp built in Germany before </p>
<p class="calibre1">the war. The giant facility, built near the town of Floss, continuously worked </p>
<p class="calibre1">inmates to death at a nearby granite quarry and Messerschmitt aircraft fac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tory. When enfeebled prisoners by the thousands dropped dead from malnu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trition and exhaustion, their bodies were quickly cremated.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  Flossenbiirg  was  primarily  a  slave  labor  camp,  it  relied  heavily </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Hollerith  machines  to  coordinate  the  work  battalions  transferring  in  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out from other major camps or its own sub-camps. The camp's well-developed </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Department  tracked  its  slaves  by  name  and number.  During  Septem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  1944,  thousands  of  prisoners  were  transferred  to  Flossenbiirg  proper  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">its smaller sub-camps. On September 1, 1944, for example, Flossenbiirg's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith Department received secret notice #1049/44, specifying that six of </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  sub-camps  were  transferring  a  total  of  2,324  cards  corresponding  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  attached  "Hollerith  Transfer  Lists."  From  Camp  Neurohlau:  561;  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camp  Zwodau:  887;  from  Camp  Graslitz:  150;  from  Holleischen:  603;  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Camp  Helmbrechts:  100.  Seventeen  women  were  also  transferred  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  Flossenbiirg  detachment.  The  secret  notice  to  Flossenbiirg's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  explained:  'The  inmates'  files  have  been  kept  in  the  records  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  local  camps  up  until  and  including  August  31,  as  was  already  reported  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">telegram. The transfer lists for the Hollerith card file are attached as well."33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notice  #1049/44  to  Flossenbiirg  also  stressed  that  although  2,324  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  accompanying  the  Hollerith  transfer  printouts,  six  women  had  escaped </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  past  few  months.  "The  inmates'  files  have  been  removed  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">records  of  local  camps,  after  their  escape,"  the  notice  instructed,  "and  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">records  have  to  be  reinserted  into  the  files  upon  their  capture."  The  six </p>
<p class="calibre1">women were listed by name and Hollerith number: </p>
<p class="calibre1">#22941 Basargina, Elena </p>
<p class="calibre1">#23021 Edwokimenko, Diana </p>
<p class="calibre1">#30279 Baranecka, Lena </p>
<p class="calibre1">#28803 Krlanisch, Valentina </p>
<p class="calibre1">#29306 Saganjatsch, Nadia </p>
<p class="calibre1">#34434 Hildinberg, Gertrud34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Printouts  from  Flossenbiirg's  Hollerith  Department  were  used  to  organ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ize and accompany the transfer not only of large slave groups numbering </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  1,000  but  small  work  gangs  as  well.  On  January  24,  1945,  Flos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">senburg's  Arbeitseinsatz  received  notice  from  another  camp's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department:  "We  are  su b m i t t i n g   inmate  personal  cards  for  200  inmates </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  to  work  camp  Helmbrechts  and  200  inmates  transferred  to  work </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp  Dresden  .  .  .  Hollerith  lists  are  included."  Several  months  before,  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">September  1,  1944,  Flossenbiirg's  Arbeitseinsatz  received  a  similar  order  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  half  as  many  inmates.  "In  the  attachment,"  the  September  4,  1944,  notice </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed,  "find  enclosed  the  inmate  personal  cards  for  100  inmates  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred  to  work  camp  Witt  in  Helmbrechts  on  August  31,  1944.  The  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer list is included."35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  lists  could  be  produced  for  as  few  persons  as  needed.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  13,  1944,  Flossenbiirg's  Arbeitseinsatz  received  orders  involving </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  four  women:  "The  inmate  personal  cards  for  4  female  inmates  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred  to  work  camp  Helmbrechts  on  November  9,  1944,  as  well  as  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer  list  Number  123  are  submitted  in  the  attachment.  We  are  requesting </p>
<p class="calibre1">the speediest delivery of personal file cards for the 4 transferred inmates."36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  many  punch  card  operations  in  concentration  camps,  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">haps  the  most  active  was  the  massive  Hollerith  Department  at  Mauthausen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant Austrian camp was really an extensive complex of slave labor quar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ries  and  factories,  operated  with  a  brutal  furor  calculated  to  quickly  work </p>
<p class="calibre1">inmates  to  death.  Sadistic  labor  conditions  amid  unspeakable  daily  atrocities </p>
<p class="calibre1">killed  thousands.  Numerous  Mauthausen  sub-camps  functioned  as  satellites </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  similar  vein.  Moreover,  as  camps  consolidated  late  in  the  war,  captives </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  continuously  shipped  into  the  camp  so  Mauthausen  received  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">transfers  from  other  facilities.  Hollerith  operators  located  in  the  Arbeitsein- </p>
<p class="calibre1">satz,  across  from  the  Political  Section,  could  see  the  entire  parade  grounds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including the arrival of everiy prisoner transport.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  low-level  SS  officer  supervised  Mauthausen's  Hollerith  Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  day-to-day  sorts  and  tabulations  were  undertaken  by  a  Russian-born </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  army  lieutenant  POW  named  Jean-Frederic  Veith.  Veith  arrived  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mauthausen  on  April  22,  1943,  just  days  before  his  fortieth  birthday.  He  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly  assigned  to  the  tabulators.  Among  Veith's  duties  was  processing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  Hollerith  lists  from  other  camps,  not  only  transferred  prisoners  for  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">assignment, but also those the sorts had determined were misrouted.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veith  compiled  both  the  voluminous  death  lists  and  new  arrival  ros- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters,  and  then  dispatched  the  daily  "strength  numbers"  to  Berlin.  His  section </p>
<p class="calibre1">stamped  each  document  Hollerith  erfasst—"Hollerith  registered"—and  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporated the figures into the camp's burgeoning database. Hence, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">enormity of Mauthausen's carnage was ever-present in his mind as he ran the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mauthausen  "Departure  Lists"  were  fundamentally  roll  calls  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">dead.  A  typical  handwritten  "Departure  List"  ran  on  for  many  pages,  thirty </p>
<p class="calibre1">lines  per  page.  No  names  were  used, just the inmate's  five-  or  six-digit  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  identity,  listed  on  the  left  in  numerical  order  for  efficient  punching  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">column  22  of  the  Dehomag  cards  printed  for  camp  death  tallying.  The  vic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tim's  birth  date  was  penned  into  the  next  table  for  punching  into  section  5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Death dates were scrawled in the right field set aside for section 25.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cause of death was recorded for column 24. Generally, the murdered </p>
<p class="calibre1">inmate itemized on the top line was coded C-3, the Hollerith designation for </p>
<p class="calibre1">"natural causes." For convenience, ditto marks signifying "natural causes" </p>
<p class="calibre1">would then be dashed next to every inmate number. But these death cita- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions were faked. For amusement, Mauthausen guards might force an inmate </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  jump  off  the  quarry  cliff  at  a  spot  called  "the  Parachute  Jump."  Exhausted </p>
<p class="calibre1">laborers  might  be  crowded  into  the  tiled  gas  chamber  below  the  sick  bay </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  carbon  monoxide  billows  would  suffocate  their  lives.  Undesirables </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  be  terminated  in  "Operation  K"  actions—a  bullet  administered  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">close  range.  Or  special  cases  might  be  hoisted  by  their  arms  tied  behind  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">backs  until  they  died  from  the  socket-wrenching  excruciation.  All  these  mur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ders were almost always dittoed C-3, "natural causes."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Hollerith  installations  at  Auschwitz,  Buchenwald,  Dachau,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mauthausen  were  only  part  of  an  extensive  network  of  camp  punching  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulating  services  that  stretched  across  Europe.  At  Stutthof  camp  in  subju- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gated  Poland,  coded  012,  the  Hollerith  Department  used  six-digit  registrations </p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning  with  zero.  At  the  nightmarish  Gusen  camps,  the  Hollerith  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  only  set  up  to  record  personal  biographical  and  work  assignments, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  also  recorded  the  gruesome  details  of  painful  punishments  adminis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tered  to  prisoners,  such  as  floggings  and  hanging  from  a  tree  with  arms </p>
<p class="calibre1">bound  in  back.  At  Westerbork  transfer  camp  in  Holland,  Hitler's  Holleriths </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  used  to  schedule  efficient  trainfuls  of  prisoners  destined  for  Auschwitz </p>
<p class="calibre1">gas chambers, and then report the numbers back to the registration office.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Bergen-Belsen,  where  surviving  prisoners  were  described  by  libera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors  as  "emaciated  apathetic  scarecrows  huddled  together  in  wooden  huts," </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hollerith  cards  were  maintained  in  a  barracks  dubbed  "the  lion's  den," </p>
<p class="calibre1">located  in  the  Arbeitseinsatz.  To  obliterate  all  evidence  of  the  mass  murders </p>
<p class="calibre1">documented  by  the  Hollerith  records,  Himmler  ordered  all  camp  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">indices to be destroyed before the Allies arrived.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Ravensbruck  woman's  camp,  coded  010,  the  busy  Hollerith  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  used  its  own  "Ravensbruck"  rubber  stamp  to  save  time  w r i t i n g.   Punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  operators  at  Ra v e n s b r u c k   often  identified  their  work  by  letter,  rather </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  number.  A  stream  of  Hollerith  transfer  lists  always  accompanied </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ravensbruck  slave  women  transported  to  various  factory  sites  and  camps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  could  live  as  long  as  one  could  work.  Ravensbriick  women  always  knew </p>
<p class="calibre1">fellow  prisoners  were  about  to  be  exterminated  when  a  trusty  abrupdy  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trieved  their  cards.  One  British  inmate  recalled  in  a  secret  letter  written  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  time,  'The  selected  ones  have  to  wait  in  front  of  the  Block  .  .  .  while  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[trusty]  .  .  .  who  has  noted  their  numbers  goes  to  the  Arbeitseinsatz  and  gets </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  cards  (which  are  only  removed  if  the  prisoner  is  dead).  An  hour  later </p>
<p class="calibre1">she returns with the cards and a lorry and they go—never to return."44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  SS  Economics  Administration,  under  the  leadership  of  Gruppen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fuhrer  Oswald  Pohl,  utilized  Hollerith  systems  for  more  than  specific  prisoner </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking.  IBM  machinery  helped  the  SS  manage  the  massive  logistics  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  camp  system.  Although  millions,  representing  many  nationalities  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">religions,  were  imprisoned  at  various  times  in  hundreds  of  installations,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">total  camp  capacity  on  any  given  day  was  between  500,000  and  700,000.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  required  population  management.  Jews  from  across  Europe  were  being </p>
<p class="calibre1">continuously transported into the camps.  At the same time,  slaves within camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">confines died or reached the limits of their utility to the Reich. The prodigious </p>
<p class="calibre1">task  of  efficiendy  scheduling  deportation  from  cities  and  ghettos  in  many  coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries,  the  daily  work  assignments,  and  outright  extermination  timetables  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  impossible  without  the  daily  strength  reports.  When  the  camps </p>
<p class="calibre1">reached  the  maximum  of  even  their  inhumane  overcrowded  capacity,  orders </p>
<p class="calibre1">went out from Berlin to reduce the density. Those periodic orders issued by the </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS  Economics  Administration  were  based  on  the  well-honed  statistics  provided </p>
<p class="calibre1">by the Holleriths both in the camps and at camp administration headquarters.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  a  special  statistical  bureau  was  eventually  established  in  January </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944  to  coordinate  and  tabulate  all  new  registrations,  death  lists,  daily </p>
<p class="calibre1">strength  reports,  and  transfers  from  site  to  site.  This  virtually  unknown  secret </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  facility  was  simply  called  Zentral  Institut,  that  is,  the  "Central  In- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stitute."  Each  day,  camps  would  forward  copies  of  their  strength  reports  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zentral  Institut,  located  on  a  quiet,  residential  street  in  Block  F  at  129 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrichstrasse in Berlin.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  location  was  tranquil,  the  traffic  in  and  out  was  constant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couriers  delivered  weekly  "Departure  Lists"  from  the  various  camps.  For  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ample,  Mauthausen's  list  for  week  37  of  1944  was  six  pages  long—virtually </p>
<p class="calibre1">all deceased. For week 40, the list was seven pages long. For week 41, it was </p>
<p class="calibre1">six pages, recording 325 deaths. For week 44, seven pages listed 369 prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  October  17,  1944,  delivery  of  prisoner  cards  from  Mauthausen's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department included data on 6,969 males and 399 females.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zentral  Institut,  at  Block  F,  129  Friedrichstrasse,  was  able  to  render  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">big  picture  only  because  it  processed  the  most  individualized  details.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">instance,  on  January  2,  1944,  the  SS  officer  in  charge  of  Mauthausen's  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  Department  informed  his  counterparts  at  Flossenburg's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  about  three  named  and  numbered  prisoners  who  had  recendy </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  in.  One  died  in  transport  and  two  others  were  utilized  in  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">unspecified  secret  project.  Since  they  were  never  actually  registered  at  Mau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thausen,  the  Hollerith  Department  suggested  their  names  just  be  sent  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zentral Institut as "departures."49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zentral  Institut's  elaborate  Hollerith  banks  at  Block  F,  129  Friedrich- </p>
<p class="calibre1">strasse  were  expensive  Dehomag  systems.  But  the  SS  could  more  than  justify </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cost  because  slave  labor  was  sold  by  the  SS  Economics  Administration </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  managed  as  a  profit  center.  Enterprises  as  large  as  the  heavy  industries </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  I.G.  Farben,  as  delicate  as  Hotel  Glasstuben,  and  as  small  as  a  local  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness,  routinely  contracted  for  slave  labor  with  Department  DII,  which  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erned  all  slave  labor  assignments.  For  instance,  in  late  July  1942,  farmer </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam  Bar  of  Wurzelbrunn,  short  on  farmhands  for  his  beet  fields,  applied  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">DII for two farm slaves from Flossenburg.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  SS  Economics  Administration,  which  had  total  operational  control </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  all  camps,  could  supply  exactly  the  skilled  workers  required  and  transfer </p>
<p class="calibre1">people from camp to camp, and factory to factory, by setting the dials of their </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  systems  that  had  stored  the  details  of  all  inmate  cards.  Two  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portant  inmate  cards  were  utilized.  The  Personal  Inmate  Card  was  used  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">on-site  camp  registration  and  stayed  with  the  individual  in  the  field.  DII's </p>
<p class="calibre1">centralized  version  was  simply  called  "Inmate  Card."  Every  Inmate  Card  held </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  DII's  Central  Inmate  File  fisted  the  prisoner's  profession  in  a  field  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched  into  column  10  of  the  IBM  card.  For  example,  Spanish  inmate </p>
<p class="calibre1">30543  was  listed  as  a  lumberman.  That  qualified  30543  to  be  assigned  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Neuengamme  concentration  camp  as  a  "helper"  in  any  slave  enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occupational  details  for  column  10  were  provided  by  the  top  line  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">reverse side of the Personal Inmate Card.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maschinelles  Berichtwesen,  the  Reich's  central  punch  card  agency,  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  develop  the  slave  labor  punch  card  in  conjunction  with  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers.  These  cards  listed  inmates  by  nationality  and  trade.  After  match- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  any  of  the  millions  of  slaves  and  conscripted  workers,  both  in  camps  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">incoming foreign labor battalions, to the numerous requests by both private </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies and public works, DII could promptly deploy workers where they </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  needed,  when  they  were  needed.52  In  this  sense,  DII  acted  like  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">worker placement agency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charges  for  DII's  workers  could  be  easily  tabulated  on  Dehomag's  well- </p>
<p class="calibre1">established  hourly  wage  cards,  thereby  generating  instant  slave  billings.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">typical  monthly  charge  to  Messerschmitt  airplane  works  for  Flossenburg </p>
<p class="calibre1">slaves  was  the  one  itemized  on  DII's  invoice  #FLO  680,  which  was  issued </p>
<p class="calibre1">December 1, 1944: </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  50,778 full-time skilled slaves at RM 5 per day </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  5,157 part-time skilled slaves at RM 2.50 per day </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  53,071 full-time helpers at RM 3 daily </p>
<p class="calibre1">•  5,600 part-time helpers at just RM 1.50 daily </p>
<p class="calibre1">Messerschmitt's  total  invoice  for  the  month  of  November  1944  was  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">434,395.50.  Although  Messerschmitt  employed  114,606  Flossenbiirg  slaves  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">November 1942, once the month closed on November 30, DII was able to gen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erate  an  itemized  invoice  within  twenty-four  hours.  Prompt  payment  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">requested.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slave  revenues  for  all  camps  totaled  RM  13.2  million  for  1942.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">program  of  working  inmates  to  death  had  a  name.  The  Reich  called  it  "exter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mination  by  labor."  Atop the  ironwork  entrances  of many  slave  camps  was  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensible motto: Arbeit Macht Frei—"Work will set you free."54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">EVERY  HELL  has  its  hierarchy.  Each  Hollerith  code  carried  consequences.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  concentration  camps,  the  levels  of  inhumanity,  pain,  and  torture  were  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  happenstance  of  incarceration  as  much  as  a  destiny  assured  by  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">coding.  Many  unfortunate  groups  were  shipped  to  the  camps.  But  the  Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coded  as  they  were,  were  singled  out  for  special  cruelties  that  forced  them  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">either live a more tortured life or die a more heinous death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  impossible  to  shirk  one's  Hollerith  code.  Most  camps  classed </p>
<p class="calibre1">prisoners into sixteen categories: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Political Prisoner 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Communist Spaniard 6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bible Researcher 2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foreign Civilian Worker 7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homosexual 3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew 8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dishonorable Military Discharge </p>
<p class="calibre1">4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Asocial 9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clergy 5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Habitual Criminal 10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major Felons  11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Covert Prisoner 14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gypsy 12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hard Labor Detainee  15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prisoner of War  13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Diplomatic Consul 16.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  arrival,  all  prisoners  would  register  and  receive  their  five-digit  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mate  number,  as  well  as  a  striped  uniform  sewn  with  a  color-coded  triangu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lar  chest  patch.  The  patch  identified  the  man  at  a  distance  to  both  guards </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  more  privileged  prisoners.  Generally,  but  not  always,  political  criminals </p>
<p class="calibre1">wore  red  patches.  Homosexuals  wore  pink.  Serious  criminals  wore  green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews,  coded  8,  were  forced  to  wear  two  triangular  patches  forming  the  six- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed  Star  of  David.  Various  additional  markings  and  colors  on  the  yellow </p>
<p class="calibre1">star connoted either "race polluter" or political Jew.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As horrific as camps were for all, Jews coded by number experienced </p>
<p class="calibre1">an additional nightmare of unspeakable dimension. Because Jews were in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly recognizable by their patches, they could be denounced at every turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">as "Jewish swine," or "Jewish muck," with the attendant physical abuse.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One could never escape his code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coded  maltreatment  also  meant  segregated  quarters  and  more  severe </p>
<p class="calibre1">work  conditions  for  Jews.  In  Buchenwald,  for  example,  Jews  were  almost  al- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ways  confined  to  the  so-called  Little  Camp,  where  prisoners  were  housed </p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteen  to  a  12'  x  12'  "shelf,"  triple-decked.  Many  new  inmates  were  initiated </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  spending  time  in  the  Litde  Camp,  where  they  were  expected  to  quickly </p>
<p class="calibre1">lose  about  40  percent  of  their  body  weight,  and  then  move  on  to  other  bar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">racks.  But  Jews  were  not  released.  Emaciated  Jewish  prisoners  who  "had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  around  long  enough"  or  who  refused  to  be  mentally  broken,  were  arbi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trarily condemned to death—generally an entire shelf at a time.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  the  murder  decision  had  been  made,  all  sixteen  Jews  in  the  shelf </p>
<p class="calibre1">were immediately marched to a small door adjacent to Buchenwald's incinera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tor  building.  The  door  opened  inwards  creating  a  short,  three-foot-long  corri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dor.  Jews  were  pushed  and  herded  until  they  reached  the  corridor  end.  There, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  hole  dropped  thirteen  feet  down  a  concrete  shaft  and  into  the  Strangling </p>
<p class="calibre1">Room. A camp worker recalled, "As they hit the floor they were garroted ... by </p>
<p class="calibre1">big  SS  guards  and  hung  on  hooks  along  the  side  wall,  about  6  1/2  feet  above </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  floor...  any  who  were  still  struggling  were  stunned  with  a  wooden  mallet </p>
<p class="calibre1">... An electric elevator ... ran [the corpses] up to the incinerator room."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  another  camp,  Jews  were  once  singled  out  on  Hanukkah,  the  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">festival  of  fights  that  features  the  lighting  of  small  candles.  Guards  ordered </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews to gather round. Eight were selected and strung upside down. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews were then forced to douse the hanging men with oil, and ignite them </p>
<p class="calibre1">one by one. As the immolating Jews shrieked in pain, the unfortunate audi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ence was compelled to joyously sing t he Christinas carol "Silent Night."60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  smallest  of  infractions,  including  not  standing  completely  erect </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  speaking  out  of  line,  Jews  were  regularly  flogged  in  an  official  method </p>
<p class="calibre1">prescribed  by  Berlin  administrators.  For  example,  Jews  were  tied  to  a  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  twenty-five  lashes  on  the  buttocks  delivered  by  exuberant  guards  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">often  jumped  into  the  air  to  increase  momentum.  If  the  Jew  screamed  out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  beating  was  increased  ten  more  strokes.  Because  they  were  Jews—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  because  they  were  Jews—if  the  guard  was  in  the  mood  he  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase the number to sixty lashes.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  random  cruelties  such  as  floggings,  kicking,  testicle  beatings,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  sadistic  acts  were  inflicted  against  Jews,  especially  by  those  of  higher </p>
<p class="calibre1">rank  among  the  prisoners,  such  as  Poles  or  German  criminals.  Other  prison- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers  often  attempted  to  curry  favor  with  their  guards  by  brutalizing  Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guards  often  demanded  it  as  sport.  Jews,  no  matter  how  broken  or  bloody, </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  be  admitted  to  the  infirmary  at  some  camps;  one  inmate  recalls </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews were classed as "well or dead."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  codes  afflicted  not  just  Jews,  but  others  at  the  bottom  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">hierarchy  of  camp  victims.  For  example,  Jehovah's  Witnesses  were  coded  2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Known  as  "Bible  Researchers,"  Jehovah's  Witnesses  were  singled  out  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  abstinent  refusal  to  register  for  the  German  draft  and  their  Christian </p>
<p class="calibre1">rejection  of  anti-Semitism.  They  were  rewarded  with  a  greater  level  of  mal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment  than  almost  any  prisoner  other  than  a  Jew  coded  8.  To  relieve  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">daily  agony  of  beatings  and  camp  killings,  Jehovah's  Witnesses  needed  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  sign  a  declaration  denouncing  their  church  and  submit  to  the  military </p>
<p class="calibre1">draft.  This  they  steadfastly  declined  to  do.  For  their  courage  and  conscience, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jehovah's Witnesses were tortured and slaughtered.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each  special  incarcerated  group  bore  the  horrors  inflicted  by  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">codes.  Homosexuals  coded  3  and  assigned  pink  triangles  were  singled  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  bestial  treatment.  Even  traditional  Germans  who  had  been  classed  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">"work-shy"  or  "asocial,"  that  is,  people  who  simply  did  not fit  the  Nazi  mold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">found  themselves  the  targets  of  specially  prescribed  mistreatment  in  ways </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  other  coded  prisoners  were  not.  The  bottom  of  the  Personal  Inmate </p>
<p class="calibre1">Card  logged  prescribed  tortures  in  a  section  headed  Strafen  im  Lager,  "Pun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ishment  Administered  in  Camp."  In  addition  to  daily  random  brutalities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">officially  prescribed  punishment  was  often  meted  out  on  specific  orders </p>
<p class="calibre1">issued  by  the  SS  Economics  Administration in  Berlin.  The  agency  had  instant </p>
<p class="calibre1">access to an inmate's history of prior infractions and punishment. Typical was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Personal Inmate Card for Auschwitz I I I  prisoner 11457; directly over the </p>
<p class="calibre1">section entitled Strafen im Lager w a s  t h e  t el l t al e  stamp, Hollerith erfasst.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  transferring  to  another  camp,  one's  coded  identity  was  never  left </p>
<p class="calibre1">behind.  Zentral  Institut  Hollerith  Transfer  Lists  always  included  it.  Even  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">death,  Nazi  victims  were  coded.  Four  main  death  codes  were  punched  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zentral Institut Hollerith cards: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Death by natural causes </p>
<p class="calibre1">C-3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Execution </p>
<p class="calibre1">D-4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suicide </p>
<p class="calibre1">E-5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">SB Special Treatment </p>
<p class="calibre1">F-665 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  death  reports  were  coded  C-3,  even  when  people  were  openly </p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered.  But  the  fourth  death  code  was  in  fact  a  secret  one.  F-6  stood  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">SB,  Sonderbehandlung  or  "Special  Treatment."  Any  punishment  coded  F-6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">was in fact an order for extermination, either by gas chamber or bullet.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  multitude  of  columns  and  codes  punched  into  Hollerith  and  sorted </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  instant  results  was  an  expensive,  never-ending  enterprise  designed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">implement  Hitler's  evolving  solutions  to  what  was  called  the  Jewish  problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Germany's  first  identifying  census  in  1933,  to  its  sweeping  occupa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  and  social  expulsions,  to  a  net  of  ancestral  tracings,  to  the  Nuremberg </p>
<p class="calibre1">definitions  of  1935,  to  the  confiscations,  and  finally  to  the  ghettoizations,  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  codes  that  branded  the  individual  and  sealed  his  destiny.  Each  code </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a brick  in an inescapable  wall  of  data. Trapped by  their  code, Jews could </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  helplessly  wait  to  be  sorted  for  Germany's  next  persecution.  The  system </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  created  in  its  own  midst,  it  also  exported  by  conquest  or  subver- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion.  As  the  war  enveloped  all  Europe,  Jews  across  the  Continent  found </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves numbered and sorted to one degree or another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  early  1942,  a  change  had  occurred.  Nazi  Germany  no  longer  killed </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  Jewish  people.  It  killed  Jewish  populations.  This  was  the  data-driven </p>
<p class="calibre1">denouement of Hitler's war against the Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  codes,  compilations,  and  rapid  sorts  had  enabled  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  to  make  an  unprecedented  leap  from  individual  destruction  to  some- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  on  a  much  larger  scale.  No  longer  were  such  vague  notions  as "destruc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion"  and  "elimination"  bandied  ambiguously  in  speeches  and  decrees.  From </p>
<p class="calibre1">early  1942,  the  prophetic  new  Nazi  word  openly  pronounced  in  newspapers </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  extermination.  The  context,  as  spoken  in  Europe  and  widely  reported  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  media,  always  connoted  but  one  objective:  mass  killing.  Systematic  co- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinated extermination would yield an unimaginable new solution to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish problem in Europe. This ultimate phase was known as Endlosung. In </p>
<p class="calibre1">German, the term conveyed a s i n g u l a r  meaning: "'The Final Solution."67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">SEVERAL  FORCES  were  in  play  on  January  1,  1942,  as  Hitler  set  the  Final  So- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lution in motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  the  Reich  was  well  along  in  implementing  its  policy  of  pauperiz- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  and  enslaving  European  Jewry.  In  this  campaign,  the  goal  of  emigration </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  become  essentially  curtailed  or  nonexistent,  replaced  by  a  program  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">"extermination  by  labor,"  organized  ghetto  starvation,  and  pit  massacres.  Still </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  Jews  were  hearty  enough,  or  lucky  enough,  to  survive  the  rigors  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">inhumane Nazi-style "forced labor," or escape into the forests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  the  long-standing  goal  of  the  Nazi  movement,  that  is,  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plete  destruction  of  the  Jewish  people,  was  now  crystallizing.  For  years,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">debate  within  Nazi  circles  had  taken  many  forms,  including  physical  extermi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation.  Hitler  had  publicly  prophesied  in  1939  that  if  the  world  again </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned  to  war,  he  would  utterly  destroy  the  Jewish  people.  In  Hitler's  view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  conflict  in  Europe  became  a  "World  War"  when  America  entered  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pearl  Harbor  was  bombed  in  December  1941.  Der  Fuhrer  was  now  deter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mined  to  unleash  a  long  contemplated  campaign  of  systematic,  automated </p>
<p class="calibre1">genocide, thus once and for all ridding the world of Jews.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  weeks  after  America  entered  the  war  with  Germany,  the  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">related  campaigns  accelerated:  extermination  by  labor,  and  the  new  drive  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">exterminate  all  Jews  by  the  most  expedient  method  possible.  On  January  20, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942,  a  top-secret  conference  of  Hitler's  key  lieutenants  was  held  in  a  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">suburb  at  the  elegant  terraced  villa  located  at  Am  Grossen  Wannsee  56-58. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  purpose:  coordinate  the  efficient  murder  of  millions  of  Jews.  The  secret </p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering  was  limited  to  senior  Nazi  leadership,  including  Reinhard  Hey- </p>
<p class="calibre1">drich,  the  head  of  Security  Police,  and  Gestapo  Chief  Heinrich  Muller.  Yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  conferees  in  many  ways  relied  upon  three  key  lower-level  experts.  One </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  Roderich  Plate,  a  racial  census  expert.  The  second  was  Richard  Korherr, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler's  handpicked  statistical  overlord.  The  third  was  Adolf  Eichmann. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plate was Korherr's assistant and both were established Hollerith experts.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  meeting,  Heydrich  presented  a  long  list  of  Jewish  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions,  broken  down  by  territory  and  country.  Eichmann  provided  the  list </p>
<p class="calibre1">based  on  compilations  by  Korherr  and  Plate.  Working  with  a  coterie  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">current  and  former  Dehomag  experts,  they  developed  the  statistics.  The  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clave at Wannsee resulted in a Protocol, which outlined the massive demo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">graphic  and  geographic  logistical  challenge. The printed Protocol's center- </p>
<p class="calibre1">piece was, in fact, the st atisti cal  report on the mission ahead.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany:  131,800;  Ostmark  region:  43,700;  Eastern  territories:  420,000; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occupied  Poland:  2,284,000;  Bialystok:  400,000;  Bohemia  and  Moravia: </p>
<p class="calibre1">74,200;  Latvia:  3,500;  Lithuania:  34,000;  Belgium:  43,000;  Denmark:  5,600; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occupied  France:  165,000;  Unoccupied  France:  700,000;  Greece:  69,600; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Netherlands:  160,800;  Norway:  1,300.  .  .  .  The  long  enumeration  of  popu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lation  statistics  went  on,  country  after  country,  and  even  included  England </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Ireland.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Protocol's  grand  total  was  11  million  including  the  British  Isles  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  broad  estimate  of  5  million  for  Russia.  The  conference  was  told,  "the  num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  of  Jews  given  here  for  foreign  countries  includes,  however,  only  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  who  still  adhere  to  the  Jewish  faith,  since  some  countries  still  do  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">have a definition of the term 'Jew' according to racial principles."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr's  estimates  for  the  conference  were  profoundly  inflated.  Cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tainly,  Reich  experts  had  been  able  to  create  precise  population  tables  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greater  Germany  and  most  of  the  occupied  territories.  But,  at  the  time,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  simply  lacked  accurate  information  about  many  other  countries,  espe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cially  Russia.  Nonetheless,  for  the  Nazi  leadership  assembled,  the  numbers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">howsoever  inaccurate,  presented  the  oudine  of  the  genocidal  task  they  faced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was massive and unprecedented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  two-tiered  genocide  was  emphasized:  extermination  by  labor  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">expedient  mass  murder.  "In  the  course  of  the  final  solution  the  Jews  are  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  allocated  for  appropriate  labor  in  the  East,"  the  Protocol  recorded.  "Able- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bodied  Jews,  separated  according  to  sex,  will  be  taken  in  large  work  columns </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  these  areas  for  work  on  roads,  in  the  course  of  which  action,  doubdess,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">large  portion  will  be  eliminated  by  natural  causes.  The  possible  final  remnant </p>
<p class="calibre1">will,  since  it  will  undoubtedly  consist  of  the  most  resistant  portion,  have  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  treated  accordingly,  because  it  is  the  product  of  natural  selection  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  the  course  of  the  practical  execution  of  the  Final  Solution,  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  be  combed  through  from  west  to  east.  .  .  .  The  evacuated  Jews  will  first </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  sent,  group  by  group,  to  so-called  transit  ghettos,  from  which  they  will  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">transported  to  the  East."  Jews  in  Poland  were  specified  as  "epidemic  carriers" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  "of  approximately  2.5  million  Jews,  the  majority  is  unfit  for  work."74  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  parlance  of  Wannsee,  those  "unfit  for  work"  were  to  be  put  to  death  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As daunting as the deportation campaign would be, the Nazis insisted it </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  subordinated  to  their  own  Nuremberg  racial  theories.  A  complicated  list </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  mandatory  or  potential  exceptions  was  l a i d   out.  For  example,  "persons  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixed  blood  of  the  f i r st   degree  married  to  persons  of  German  blood"  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be "treated essentially as Germans."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Wannsee  Conference  and  its  Protocol  were  considered  by  many  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  the  next  major  step  in  the  Final  Solution  of  the  Jewish  problem  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.  Although  most  of  the  bizarre  formulaic  exceptions  would  be  eventu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  discarded,  and  although  the  true  number  of  Jews  existing  in  Europe  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">vasdy  overstated  in  the  meeting,  this  much  was  apparent:  the  Final  Solution </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  require  an  enormous  amount  of  statistical  information.  Korherr, </p>
<p class="calibre1">assisted by Plate, was ready to provide it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plate  was  an  experienced  Hollerith  expert.  After  a  stint  as  administra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive  assistant  with  the  Reich  Statistical  Office,  he  joined  the  Race  Political </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  of  the  NSDAP  in  1935.  Soon  thereafter,  he  assisted  noted  raceologist </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich  Burgdorfer  in  compiling  an  estimate  of  all  racial  Jews  in  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  he  helped  produce  a  second  estimate,  this  one  of  World  Jewry.  In  suc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceeding  years,  Plate  functioned  as  the  Reich  Statistical  Office's  liaison  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann's  Referat  II  112,  also  known  as  the  Jewish  Division.  Plate  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">described  by  colleagues  as  an  expert  "in  all  important  questions  regarding </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  census,  religious  and  race  statistics,  special  counts  of  Jews,  special  counts </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  foreigners,  and  minority  statistics."  Plate,  a  civilian  when  Wannsee  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vened,  was  required  to  sign  an  oath  of  secrecy  three  days  before  the  confer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ence and was drafted into the military five days later.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  was  the  most  important  statistics  man  in  the  Nazi  hierarchy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irritable,  defensive,  and  almost  possessive  about  his  Hollerith  machines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  had  been  developing  race-oriented  punch  card  programs  for  years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always  a  rabid  raceologist  and  statistical  adventurer,  his  early  writings </p>
<p class="calibre1">denounced  the  "niggerization"  of  France  and  urged  the  defense  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"white race."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  career  included  work  with  the  Reich  Statistical  Office,  and  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">service  as  the  Director  of  Population  Politics  and  Statistics  for  Deputy  Fuhrer </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hess.  But  Korherr  did  not  become  the  undisputed  syndic  of  all  Nazi  statistics </p>
<p class="calibre1">until  December  9,  1940.  On  that  day,  Himmler  issued  and  personally  signed </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  explicit  orders.  The  first  appointed  Korherr  Inspector  of  Statistics  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS  as  well  as  for  the  Chief  of  the  German  Police.  The  second  outlined </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr's  broad  portfolio.  By  any  reading,  it  was  an  extraordinary  entitle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  and  cachet  for  one  who  might  be  viewed  as  a  mere  statistical  techni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cian.  But  Korherr  was  more  than  just  a  number  cruncher.78  He  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become the keeper of the state's most incriminating genocidal secrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  Inspector  reports  directly  to  me  and  receives  his  instructions  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">me  personally,"  ordered  SS  Chief  Himmler  in  Korherr's  bona  fides.  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspector  is  solely  responsible  for  the  totality  of  statistics  of  all  units  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices in my area. The work of the Inspector is to be supported in every way </p>
<p class="calibre1">possible  in  light  of  the  necessity  and  significance  [of]  .  .  .  practical  statistics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  The  Inspector  is  the  sole  point  of  contact  between  the  Reich  and  provin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial and Party statistics."79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  was  more  than  willing  to  jealously  guard  his  domain  of  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  expertise,  even  if  it  meant  tangling  with  Nazidom's  top  generals.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  one  general  at  the  Wannsee  Conference  was  Gruppenfuhrer  Otto </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hofmann,  the  general  in  charge  of the  politically  well-connected  SS  Race  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Settlement  Department.  The  Race  and  Settlement  Office  was  a  marginal </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  that  functioned  as  a  marriage-assistance  bureau  for  SS  officers,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore  had  to  wait  two  years  to  secure  its  own  Hollerith:  When  it  finally </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived,  Gruppenfiihrer  Hofmann  was  excited  about  his  new  Hollerith  instal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lation,  and  had  already  suggested  expansive  changes  in  statistical  campaigns </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the creation of new racial registration offices across Greater Germany. Kor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">herr openly denigrated Hofmann's ideas as unnecessary and duplicative.80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  after  the  Wannsee  Conference,  Korherr  wrote  to  a  colleague,  'T </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  like  to  mention  that  the  understandable  lack  of  statistical  expertise  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Race  and  Settlement  Office,  coupled  with  their  urgent  wish  for  a  large </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics  office  with  a  Hollerith  system  and  for  an  SS  population  card  file, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  [recent]  negotiations  extraordinarily  difficult.  For  the  statistician,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">best  proof  of  an  amateur  is  when  someone  wants  to  begin—and  end—his </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistical  work  with  a  card  file  .  .  .  Since  Reichsjuhrer  [Himmler]  appointed </p>
<p class="calibre1">me  the  sole  liaison  for  Reich  statistics  . . .   I  see  Gruppenfiihrer  Hofmann's </p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior as deliberately ... undermining my position."81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  snidely  added,  "The  person  in  charge  at  the  Reich  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  was  astonished  at  Gruppenfuhrer  Hofmann's  plans  and  asked:  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">why did Reichsjuhrer [Himmler] hire me and Dr. Plate. We were both amused </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  idea  of  a  Hollerith  survey  of  the  entire  popular  [German]  movement </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  I  suggested  the  numerical  continuation  of  the  [existing]  inventory  instead </p>
<p class="calibre1">of a [new] Hollerith system ... I should just float above it all."82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr's  expertise  was  so  valued,  Himmler  sided  with  him  even  over  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">prominent  SS  general.  Eventually,  Himmler  issued  Korherr  an  additional </p>
<p class="calibre1">directive:  "in  order  to  avoid  jurisdictional  conflicts  and  streamline  work  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cedures,  you  are  to  be  given  responsibility  for  processing  all  statistical  mat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters for [Gruppenfiihrer Hofmann's] Race and Settlement Office."83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Himmler's plenipotentiary for all statistical matters, Korherr was able </p>
<p class="calibre1">to coordinate the data activities of numerous Reich agencies  and call upon </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  Hollerith  experts  who  had  been  either  trained  by  Dehomag,  or  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  transferred  or  loaned  to  government  offices  for  the  war  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  example  was  Albert  Bartels,  head  of  the  SS  machine  record  agency  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">in charge of Waffen-SS Holleriths at Dachau. Bartels also worked at the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plex at 129 Friedrichstrasse.  In one typical packet, Bartels sent Korherr "work </p>
<p class="calibre1">progress  forms  and  punch cards  used  in  my  office.  I  ask  you  .  .  .  for  the  nec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">essary  evaluations."  Bartels'  assistant  was  Busch,  the  former  Hollerith  dealer </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  ran  the  Waffen-SS  machines  at  the  Storkow  camp.  Herbert  Blaettel,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">veteran  of  Dehomag's  training  department,  worked  at  Dachau's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department.  Dehomag's  Munich  dealer,  Herr  Asmis,  sold  the  Nazi  Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">office  its  original  leases;  he  only  left  the  subsidiary  in  August  1944  to  work </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  government  projects.  The  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen  was  the  clearing- </p>
<p class="calibre1">house  for  all  punch  card  technology,  and  their  resources  could  be  continu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ously tapped.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  January  1943,  Korherr  was  required  to  provide  Himmler  with  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">status  report  on  the  Final  Solution.  To  do  so,  Korherr  worked  frantically  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">determine  exactly  how  many  Jews  had  been  killed,  country  by  country.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded  a  stream  of  data  from  all  the  ghettos  and  other  territories  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann  had  been  working.  Eichmann  remembered  that  he  provided </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  "all  our  top-secret  stuff.  That  was  the  order.  All  the  shipments  [of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews]  insofar  as  they  had  been  reported  to  us."  Eichmann  added,  "The  statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tician  [Korherr]  was  with  me,  a  week  or  maybe  two,  in  my  office,  day  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">day, making his inquiries, he sent telegrams etc. all over the place."85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Korherr  eventually  produced  a  sixteen-page  draft  report,  but  was  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quired  to  condense  the  tabulated  data  to  just  seven  pages  so  Hitler  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">review  it.  When  Korherr  completed  the  summary,  the  perfectionist  in  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  still  frustrated.  "Despite  the  expended  sweat,  an  accurate  number  for  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  period  cannot  be  given,"  he  asserted,  but  he  assured  the  report  none- </p>
<p class="calibre1">theless  did  offer  "useful  clues."  Korherr's  progress  report  was  submitted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler on March 23, 1943.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  time,  the  numbers  were  precise,  enumerating  Jewish  communities </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  Europe,  by  ghetto  and  territory.  The  word  "evacuation"  was  used </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  designate  gassing  in  killing  centers  such  as  Treblinka  and  Sobibor.  To </p>
<p class="calibre1">eastern  Russia:  1,449,692  Jews;  to  camps  in  occupied  Poland:  1,274,166; </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  camps  in  the  Warthe  region:  145,301.  Occupied  France:  41,911; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Netherlands:  38,571;  Belgium:  16,886;  Norway:  532;  Slovakia:  56,691;  Croa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tia: 4,927. Total evacuations including Special Treatment: 1,873,519. The total </p>
<p class="calibre1">was written as more than 2.5 million to date.87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler  was  so  pleased  with  the  report  and  Korherr's  subsequent  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">formance,  he  eventually  appointed  the  statistician  to  a  specially  created </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  known  as  the  Statistical  Scientific  Institute  of  the  Reichsfuhrer  SS.  It, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,  was  located  at  Block  F,  129  Friedrichstrasse.  Korherr's  new  office  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  the  most  up-to-the-minute  access  to  all  concentration  camp  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">streaming  into  the  Zentral  Institut.  By  early  1944,  Korherr  was  able  to  report </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Eichmann  a  total  of  5  million  Jews  eliminated  by  "natural  decrease,  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">centration  camp  inmates,  ghetto  inmates,  and  those  who  were  [simply]  put </p>
<p class="calibre1">to death."88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  offices  at  Block  F,  129  Friedrichstrasse,  undoubtedly  processed </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  information  than  any  other  single  office  in  Germany  about  the  mass </p>
<p class="calibre1">murder  of  Europe's  Jews.  More  than  a  statistical  bureau,  by  its  very  nature, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hollerith  complex  at  Friedrichstrasse  helped  Hitler,  Himmler,  Heydrich, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Eichmann  prioritize,  schedule,  and  manage  the  seemingly  impossible </p>
<p class="calibre1">logistics  of  genocide  across  dozens  of  cities  in  more  than  twenty  countries </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  territories.  It  was  not  just  people  who  were  counted  and  marshaled  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">deportation.  Boxcars,  locomotives,  and  intricate  train  timetables  were  sched- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uled  across  battle-scarred  borders—all  while  a  war  was  being  fought  on  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">fronts.  The  technology  had  enabled  Nazi  Germany  to  orchestrate  the  death </p>
<p class="calibre1">of millions without skipping a note. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst  the  whirlwind  of  the  Final  Solution,  the  Third  Reich's  transition </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  blind  persecution  of  a  general  population  to  the  destruction  of  indi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">viduals  had  come  full  circle.  In  genocide,  the  Jews  lost  their  identity.  They </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  reduced  to  mere  nameless  data  bits.  Now  each  murdered  Jew  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">longer  even  represented  an  individual  death.  Now  every  corpse  comprised  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">mere component in a far larger statistical set adding up to total annihilation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Jews  were  worked  to  death,  they  were  tracked  with  Inmate </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cards,  Hollerith  Transfer  Lists,  punch  cards,  and  endless  sorters.  It  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">expensive,  but  in  the  Nazi  view,  a  necessary  cost  allowing  the  Reich  to  track </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  regiment  a  Jew's  every  move.  When  enslaved  Jews  in  work  camps  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">about to be killed, their cards were taken—they no longer needed one.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  ghettoized  Jews  were  selected  for  deportation,  and  dispatched </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Hollerith-scheduled  trains  to  killing  stations  in  Poland,  they  received  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards.  Their  names  were  not  printed  on  any  Hollerith  Transfer  List.  When </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  arrived  at  the  mass  murder  centers  in  Treblinka,  Sobibor,  Belzec,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  of  the  others  sites  reserved  for  eradication,  a  doctor  briefly  glanced  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">victims  hurriedly  filing  past.  A  wave  to  the  left  meant  reporting  to  the  camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance  for  the  prospect  of  laboring  for  a  few  days,  perhaps  a  month.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">most were never registered in any Arbeitseinsatz.90 They had oudived the </p>
<p class="calibre1">potential  for  usefulness.  They  were  expeditiously  directed  to  their  final  des- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny: the showers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  synchrony  was  exquisite.  From  the  moment  a  Jew  stepped  onto  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">train  platform  in  the  ghetto,  to  the  moment  he  was  violently  thrashed  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  boxcar  at  the  final  stop  and  led  to  his  death,  there  were  never  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">delays.  Precision  timing  and  scheduling  was  indispensable  to  the  process.  No </p>
<p class="calibre1">longer  worth  the  expense  of  a  bullet,  victims  were  gassed  in  large  groups.  At </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz—2,000 at a time. Prussic acid pellets, Zyklon B, were dropped into </p>
<p class="calibre1">water  buckets  to  accomplish  the  mass  asphyxiation.  The  screaming,  clanging </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  steel  doors,  and  shrieks  of  ancient  Jewish  incantation,  Sh'ma  Yisra'el, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped  after  fifteen  minutes.  Generally  within  an  hour  of  stepping  off  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">train, the Jews in a transport were successfully exterminated.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor  were  any  death  records  transmitted.  It  was  enough  to  inform  Zen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tral  Institut  that  the  people  had  boarded  a  train.  Hence,  the  machines  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulated  the  evacuations.  No  more  was  necessary.  From  these  trains,  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  no  escape,  no  need  for  tracking,  no  further  utility,  and  no  further  cost </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  expended.  At  this  point,  the  Jews  were  no  longer  worth  a  bullet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor the price of a single punch card.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  at  the  moment  of  extermination  did  the  Jews  of  Europe  finally </p>
<p class="calibre1">break free from Hitler's Holleriths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMANY  HAD  forced  Jews  to  help  organize  their  own  annihilation  by  es- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tablishing  Judenrate,  that  is,  Jewish  councils.  These  councils  were  generally </p>
<p class="calibre1">comprised  not  of  communal  leaders,  but  of  arbitrarily  selected  Jewish  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonalities,  frequendy  engineers.  Engineers  were  chosen  because  they  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">relate  to  the  mechanics  of  the  numerical  process  underway.  Judenrat  leaders </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ephraim  Barash  of  Bialystok  and  Adam  Czerniakow  of  Warsaw,  for  example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were both engineers. Eichmann considered himself an engineer by trade.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  council  members  who  did  not  cooperate,  or  who  even  hesitated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  quickly  murdered—often  on  the  spot.  Amid  accusations  of  collabora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  that  would  reverberate  forever,  the  Judenrate  were  faced  with  the  impos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sible  choice  of  functioning—literally  at  gunpoint—as  best  they  could,  as  long </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  they  could.  With  their  dismal  ghetto  communities  starving,  and  rotting </p>
<p class="calibre1">corpses  piled  high  in  the  streets  for  lack  of  mortuary  facilities,  the  councils </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped  to  somehow  survive  the  brutalities  of  ghetto  life,  hour  to  hour.94  Sto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ries  about  gas  chambers  at  the  end  of  the  railway  track  were  circulating.  So </p>
<p class="calibre1">by their cooperation with constant census and registration projects, as well as </p>
<p class="calibre1">organized evacuation  and, in many instances, the virtual sell selection of </p>
<p class="calibre1">names to fill the trains, the enormity of Nazi intent took shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly  it  became  apparent  to  the  men  of  the  Judenrate  that  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  conducting  census  and  other  statistical  duties  for  the  purposes  of  sur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vival  under  a  brutish  occupation,  or  evacuation  to  less  crowded  settlements </p>
<p class="calibre1">-  but  for  organized  extermination.  In  essence,  these  men  were  metering </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  own  deaths  in  cadence  to  the  overall  Nazi  timetable.  Some  were  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">withstand  the  awesome  personal  nightmare,  and  functioned  as  demanded </p>
<p class="calibre1">until  the  end.  However,  many  reached  a  point  of  personal  defiance.  When </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  point  came,  their  sole  means  of  briefly  slowing  down  the  Nazi  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">was suicide or suicidal refusal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arye  Marder,  head  of  Grodno  ghetto's  statistical  department,  submitted </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  resignation  in  November  1942,  when  German  plans  became  inescapable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  name  was  placed  on  the  next  transport.  He  committed  suicide.  So  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">family was sent in his place.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moshe  Kramarz  refused  to  sign  a  document  claiming  the  Minsk  ghetto </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  "deporting"  its  Jews  by  choice.  He  tore  the  document  into  little  pieces  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">front  of  people  and  loudly  warned  all  within  earshot  that  whether  called </p>
<p class="calibre1">"resettlement"  or  "evacuation,"  the  process  was  really  extermination.  Gestapo </p>
<p class="calibre1">officers  immediately  pummeled  him  and  his  colleagues,  dragged  the  group </p>
<p class="calibre1">away, and executed them all.96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Lukow  ghetto,  Judenrat  member  David  Liberman  collected  dona- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  from  residents  thinking  it  was  a  ransom  to  save  lives.  When  he  learned </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  money  would  only  be  used  to  pay  their  own  freight  to  the  Treblinka </p>
<p class="calibre1">death  camp,  he  shouted  at  a  German  supervisor,  "Here  is  your  payment  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  trip,  you  bloody  tyrant!"  He  tore  the  bills  into  bits  and  slapped  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man's face. Ukrainian guards killed Liberman where he stood.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bereza  Kartuska  ghetto  Judenrat  was  ordered  to  produce  a  list  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  to  assemble  at  the  marketplace  on  October  15,  1942,  "for  work  in  Rus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sia."  The  men  of  the  council  understood  the  people  would  be  traveling  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  doom.  Unwilling  to  issue  the  lists,  the  council  members  assembled  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">collectively  hanged  themselves  in  the  council  offices.  Two  physicians  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">their families joined the protest by committing suicide as well.98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Pruzana  ghetto,  forty-one  members  of  the  Judenrat  staged  a  Masada </p>
<p class="calibre1">action.  Rather  than  submit  to  a  Nazi-imposed  death,  they  and  their  families </p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered.  Poison  was  distributed.  The  children  swallowed  first.  Then  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">women.  Finally  the  men.  One  man  held  back  to  make  sure  all  had  died. Then </p>
<p class="calibre1">he gulped his. But the impoverished Judenrat simply did not have enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">poison  to  formulate  lethal  doses.  Some  people  emerged  from  mere  drowsi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness.  So  one  man  closed  the  chimney  flu,  scaled  the  windows,  and  turned  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  oven.  When  the  bodies  were  found  the  next  morning,  all  but  one  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">revived, and eventually deported to the camps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam  Czemiakow,  the  head  of  Warsaw's  ghetto  Judenrat,  the  man  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  tirelessly  organized  the  census,  began  to  see  the  process  as  wholesale </p>
<p class="calibre1">murder.  One  day,  when  the  Nazis  demanded  he  increase  the  deportation  lists </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  6,000  to  10,000,  he  drew  a  line.  Czerniakow  also  ended  his  duties  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">ending his life.100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Judenrat  resistance  never  effectively  delayed  any  German  action  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">ghettos.  With  scores  of  Jews  dying  of  starvation  or  disease  each  week,  a  col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lection  of  suicides  and  executions  simply  became  part  of  the  hellscape.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  sacrifice  made  one  thing  clear.  Even  though  they  never  comprehended </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  technologic  intricacies  of  the  process  underway,  and  although  most  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">never  seen  a  punch  card,  they  did  sense  that  all  the  registrations  and  endless </p>
<p class="calibre1">lists  added  up  to  a  single  odious  destiny.  They  fought  back  with  their  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining weapon: the power to control their own extinction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">NO      ONE    WILL  EVER    KNOW    EXACTLY    HOW    MANY    IBM   </p>
<p class="calibre1">MACHINES clattered in which ghetto zone, train depot, or concentration camp. </p>

<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  New  York  understood  about  their  location  or  use.  Machines  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">often  moved—with  or  without  IBM's  knowledge—from  the  officially </p>
<p class="calibre1">listed  commercial  or  governmental  client  to  a  deadly  Nazi  installa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion in another country, and then eventually transferred back again.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  importantly,  it  did  not  matter  whether  IBM  did  or  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  know  exacdy  which  machine  was  used  at  which  death  camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  that  mattered  was  that  the  money  would  be  waiting—once  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  a  pattern  emerged  throughout  war-ravaged  Europe.  Be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore  America  entered  the  war,  IBM  NY  and  its  subsidiaries  worked </p>
<p class="calibre1">directly  with  Germany  or  Italy,  or  its  occupying  forces.  As  part  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic  alliance,  it  also  worked  with  German  sympathizers  and  allies </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  countries  such  as  Romania,  Yugoslavia,  and  Hungary.2  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  even  order  new  subsidiaries  established  in  conquered  terri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tories  in  cadence  with  Nazi  invasions.3  Even  after  America  declared </p>
<p class="calibre1">war,  IBM  offices  worldwide  would  openly  transact  with  these  clients, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  with  other  subsidiaries,  until  the  moment  General  Ruling  11  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">triggered  for  that  particular  territory.  As  the  war  in  Europe  expanded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">General Ruling 11 jurisdiction was extended as well until all of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-dominated  Europe  was  proscribed.4  Once  U.S.  law  prohibited  transac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions,  IBM    NY's  apparent  direct    management  of  its  European  operations </p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed    to  end.      But,    in    truth,    e x e c u t i v e s     in      New      York  could    still </p>
<p class="calibre1">monitor events  and  exercise  authority   in   Europe  through  neutral  country   </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries. These overseas units always remained under the parent company's </p>
<p class="calibre1">control.  Moreover,  special  bureaucratic  exemptions  were  regularly  sought  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY,    or  its    subsidiaries,    to    continue  or  expand    business    dealings </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  occupied  Europe.5  Official  American  demands  that  business  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">curtailed were often ignored.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  the  United  States  entered  the  war,  Axis  custodians  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">appointed  as  titular  directors  of  subsidiaries  in  occupied  territory.  But  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy  custodians  never  looted  the  IBM  divisions.  Rather,  they  zealously </p>
<p class="calibre1">protected  the  assets,  extended  productivity,  and  increased  profits.  Existing </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  executives  were  kept  in  place  as  day-to-day  managers  and,  in  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">instances,  even  appointed  deputy  enemy  custodians.  In  France,  for  example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although  SS  Officer  Heinz  Westerholt  was  appointed  enemy  custodian  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC,  he,  in  turn,  appointed  Dehomag's  Oskar  Hoermann  as  deputy  custo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dian.  CEC's  Roger  Virgile  continued  as  managing  director  to  keep  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  profitable  and  productive.  In  Belgium,  Nazi  custodian  H.  Garbrecht </p>
<p class="calibre1">remained  aloof,  allowing  IBM  managers  Louis  Bosman  and  G.  Walter  Gal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">land  to  remain  in  place  and  virtually  in  command.  In  Germany,  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  of  directors  was  superseded  by  custodian  Hermann  Fellinger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  replaced  Heidinger,  and  then  insisted  that  Rottke,  Hummel,  and  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  other  managers  in  Dehomag's  twenty  offices  continue  producing  record </p>
<p class="calibre1">profits.7  Whether  overseen  by  Nazi  executives  or  Watson's  own,  IBM  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">thrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  later  war  years,  as  the  Allies  moved  across  the  western  and  east- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ern  fronts,  various  liberated  or  about-to-be  liberated  territories  emerged  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">exempt  from  prohibited  trading  under  General  Ruling  11.  Sometimes  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">applicable  regulations  changed  on  an  almost  daily  basis.  IBM  NY  or  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  would  tenaciously  check  with  American  authorities  for  permission  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">communicate  or  transact  with  previously  proscribed  subsidiaries.  When </p>
<p class="calibre1">direct  contact  was  not  possible,  American  legations  passed  the  messages  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">courtesy.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  IBM's  continuing  wartime  commerce,  the  world  was  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware  that  the  machinery  of  Nazi  occupation  was  being  wielded  to  extermi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nate as many Jews as possible as quickly as possible. After endless newspaper </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  newsreel  reports,  and  once  the  Allies  confirmed  their  own  intelligence </p>
<p class="calibre1">revelations in summer 1942, the conclusion became inescapable: Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">goal  was  nothing  short  of  complete  physical  extermination  of  all  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry.  On  December  17,  1942,  the  Allies  finally  declared  there  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">"war  crime"  trials  and  punishment.  The  Allies  warned  that  all  who  cooper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  with  Hitler's  genocide  would  be  held  responsible  before  the  bar  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">international  justice.  In  Parliament,  members  rose  in  awed  silence  as  one  MP </p>
<p class="calibre1">rang  out,  "There  are  many  today  who  .  .  . but for  the  grace  of  God  .  .  .  might </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  in  those  ghettos,  those  concentration  camps,  those  slaughter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">houses."  The  Allies'  joint  declaration  of  war  crimes  for  genocide  was  broad- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cast  and  published  as  the  top  news  in  more  than  twenty-three  languages  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world over.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  New  York  Times  article  was  headlined  "Allies  Describe  Outrages  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews,"  and  sub-headlined  "Extermination  Is  Feared."  It  led:  "What  is  happen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  the  5,000,000  Jews  of  German-held  Europe,  all  of  whom  face  extermi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation."  The  Allied  report  emphasized  calculated  starvation,  group  gassing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  shooting,  ghetto  street  scenes  "beyond  imagination,"  and  intense </p>
<p class="calibre1">deportation campaigns by railroad.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  business  was  never  about  Nazism.  It  was  never  about  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitism.  It  was  always  about  the  money.  Before  even  one  Jew  was  encased </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  hard-coded  Hollerith  identity,  it  was  only  the  money  that  mattered.  And </p>
<p class="calibre1">the money did accrue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millions  in  blocked  bank  accounts  scattered  across  Europe  were  wait- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  for  IBM,  as  well  as  its  newly  acquired  real  estate,  numerous  Hitler-era </p>
<p class="calibre1">factories  and  presses,  and  thousands  of  Hollerith  machines.  Much  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  and  plant  expansion  was  funded  by  a  fundamentally  bankrupt  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich,  which  financed  its  rapacious  operations  by  slave  labor,  massive  plun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">der,  and  cost-effective  genocide.  Where  did  Hitler's  Germany  get  the  money </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  pay  for  all  the  services,  cards,  and  leases?  Nazi  gold  and  currency  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">fungible—whether  carted  away  from  banks  in  Prague  or  pried  from  the  teeth </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jewish  carcasses  at Treblinka. The  Reich could  afford the  best.  And  it  pur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chased the best with the assets it stole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Managing  overseas  branches  and  conducting  commerce  within  the  bro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ken  fines  of  changing  wartime  regulations  was  itself  an  intensive  effort.  Each </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  subsidiary  in  Europe  spawned  its  own  epic  collection  of  bureaucratic </p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondence,  spanning  months  and  even  years.  Life  and  death  dramas </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  daily  realities  in  Belgium,  Czechoslovakia,  Italy,  and  elsewhere  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  employees  and  Hollerith  technology  intersected  with  the  victors  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">vanquished of Nazi Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  War  II  finally  ended  in  Europe  on  May  8,  1945.  Almost  immedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ately, IBM rushed in to recover its machines and bank accounts from enemy </p>
<p class="calibre1">territory.  The  wealth  of  stories  could  take  many  volumes  to  chronicle,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  much  was  clear:  there  was  no  realm  where  IBM  would  not  trade,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">none where they failed to collect—country by country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ROMANIA'S  ANTI-JEWISH  campaign  was  in  full  force  by  fall  1940.  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  already  inspired  a  murderously  anti-Semitic  regime  in  Bucharest.  Ro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">manian  strong  man  Marshal  Ion  Antonescu's  Fascist  regime  had  replicated </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  anti-Semitic  laws  of  professional  ousters  and  property  confiscation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rapidly  in  1940,  Romania  pauperized  thousands  of  Jews  in  a  highly  publi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cized  campaign.  Soon  forced  Jewish  labor  decrees  and  sporadic  pogroms </p>
<p class="calibre1">across Romania were breeding the usual headlines.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  in  January  1941,  squads  of  vicious  Iron  Guard  militants </p>
<p class="calibre1">rampaged  through  Bucharest  brutally  massacring  scores  of  Jewish  residents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  120  Jews  were  beaten,  mercilessly  bullwhipped  and  bludgeoned  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">metal  rods.  Some  were  made  to  drink  from  bloody  basins.  At  the  local </p>
<p class="calibre1">slaughterhouse, several Jews were fiendishly dismembered.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnage  in  Bucharest  and  in  other  areas  was  followed  by  waves  of  offi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial  banishment  for  many  to  various  regions  and  internment  in  camps.  More </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  100,000  Jews  were  thought  to  have  been  brutally  murdered  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">riparian  provinces  during  summer  1941.  Yet  Eichmann  and  other  Nazis  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">times  tried  to  restrain  their  Romanian  allies  because  the  Reich  believed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">random  acts  of  violence  were  "planless  and  premature."13  The  Germans </p>
<p class="calibre1">favored  a  more  orderly,  comprehensive,  and  scientific  approach  that  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">systematically annihilate all of Romanian Jewry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Population  estimates  in  Romania  were  wildly  exaggerated.  The  previous </p>
<p class="calibre1">census,  held  in  1930,  counted  756,930  individuals  who  routinely  identified </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  as  Jewish.  The  scheduled  1940  census  lacked  funding  and  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">delayed.  But  by  spring  1941,  German  experts  estimated  that  as  many  as  half </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Romania's  Jewish  citizens  had  already  been  murdered,  deported,  or  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">fled as refugees.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  hysterical  speculation  in  the  Romanian  press  suggested  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  as  2  million  Jews  remained  within  the  country.  The  speculation  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">based  on  a  misreading  of  the  prior  census.  The  1930  summaries  reported </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  of  the  756,930  practicing  Jews,  728,000  considered  themselves  "ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews"  even  if  not  religious,  and  519,000  primarily  spoke  Yiddish.  Wrongly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  three  numbers  were  added  together  by  some  Romanians  to  create  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">false  total  of  2  million.  Only  a  proper,  up-to-date  census  could  answer  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi raceologists called "the Jewish question" in Romania.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  the  new  census  was  scheduled  for  April  1941.  This  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  no  ordinary  household  count,  but  rather  a  comprehensive  inventory  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  individual,  enterprise,  farmland,  animal,  building,  profession,  and  asset </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Romania.  The  counting  itself  would  span  ten  days.  German  statisticians </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  IBM  would  assist  in  every  way.  Friedrich  Burgdorfer,  President  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bavarian  Statistical  Office,  was  invited  to  attend  as  an  official  observer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied by Dehomag expert Ludwig Hummer.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">W.  C.  Lier  confirmed  in  a  letter  to  Chauncey  in  New  York,  "As  regards </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Census  .  .  .  neither  we  nor  the  Dehomag  have  been  able  to  obtain  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">precise  information  as  regards  the  specifications  of  the  machines  which  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  in  Bucharest.  I  agreed,  exceptionally,  to  Mr.  Hummer  going  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bucharest  together  with  a  representative  of  the  German  Statistical  Office  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">order  to  analyze  the  whole  situation.  The  commercial  side  of  these  two  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">jects has been dealt with direct with Mr. Schotte and Mr. Milner."17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Romanian  business  was  not  in  Dehomag's  portfolio.  It  was  an  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terprise of IBM NY. "Watson had been preparing for the Romanian census for </p>
<p class="calibre1">years.  "During  1940,"  J.  C.  Milner  wrote  Headquarters  in  1938,  "the  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  be taken  in  several  countries,  and  we  expect  a  number  of  orders."  Milner </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped Endicott could develop a special IBM census tabulator in time.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  population  segment  of  Romania's  sweeping  ten-day  count  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">scheduled  for  April  6,  1941.  Article  2  of  the  census  decree  required  a  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  census  on  April  11  and  12.  The  entire  nation  mobilized.  Posters  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">prominently  displayed  in  post  offices,  hotels,  and  public  buildings.  Radio </p>
<p class="calibre1">programs,  editorials,  and  presidential  speeches  encouraged  everyone  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate.  For  accuracy's  sake,  volunteers  were  shunned  in  favor  of  29,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">paid  census  takers,  each  responsible  for  about  120  households.  The  women </p>
<p class="calibre1">hired  to  punch  the  Hollerith  cards  were  mainly  high  school  graduates,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  itself  was  thought  to  increase  the  processing  accuracy.  One  thousand </p>
<p class="calibre1">inspectors  would  oversee  the  overall  endeavor.  Even  Burgdorfer  admitted  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  journal  article  that  Romania's  Central  Statistical  Institute  was  "unusually </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-equipped."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Questions  designed  to  pinpoint  so-called  "race  Jews"  were  included  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  the  Jewish  and  general  census  questionnaires.  The  religion  question </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  only  asked  for  an  individual's  current  faith,  but  also  his  religion  at  birth; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  same  information  was  solicited  about  the  person's  father  and  mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  ethnicity  and  mother  tongue  categories,  similar  questions  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">posed  for  both  the  individual  and  again  for  his  parents.  Ethnicity  questions </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  also  asked  in  the  agricultural  census  and  job  census.  Even  the  commer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial ownership survey solicited responses from businessmen about their Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  partners  and  employees.  The  mass  of  overlapping  data  would  enable  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulators to triangulate on the intended target: anyone of Jewish ancestry- </p>
<p class="calibre1">even if the person were unaware of it.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specially  trained  enumerators  worked  one-on-one  to  evoke  true  ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">responses  from  the  population.  One  report  indicated  that  when  a  Gypsy </p>
<p class="calibre1">declined  to  admit  his  ethnicity,  the  suspicious  census  taker  finally  said,  "Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">write: Gypsy."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania's  census  was  intended  to  identify  all  the  nation's  Jews,  even  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  were  refugees  or  interned  in  concentration  camps.  So  IBM's  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  designed  to  record  such  designations  as  "temporarily  absent"  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees  and  "concentrated"  (that  is,  located  in  a  concentration  camp).  Sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ming  up  in  a  journal  article,  Burgdorfer  praised  the  census  as  "an  extraordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">narily  extensive  (maybe  too  vast)  program  of  registration  .  .  .  the  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">question is treated in great detail."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  Romanian  census  involved  not  just  individuals,  but  live- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock,  property,  professions,  businesses,  and  virtually  every  other  aspect  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian  life,  more  IBM  machines  would  be  needed.  In  fall  1941,  shortly </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  Chauncey  left  Germany  at  the  height  of  Dehomag's  revolt,  Lier  arrived </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Berlin to  represent  IBM  NY's  interest.  He  wanted to  make  sure  that  Rottke </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hummel  could  be  relied  upon  to  carry  out  IBM  projects  elsewhere  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.  Previously,  when  Chauncey  had  inquired  whether  tabulators  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  dispatched  to  Romania,  Hummel  responded  with  what  might  seem  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">lack  of  initiative.  "We  have  not  furnished  any  to  Romania,"  replied  Hummel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  seemed  to  be  waiting  for  direct  orders,  saying,  "If  Geneva  gives  us  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">order for Romania, we will fill it."23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Lier,  Romania  was  clearly  a  priority.  "One  of  the  first  matters  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cussed  with  them,"  Lier  reported  to  Chauncey  on  October  10,  1941,  "was </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  of  the  Romanian  census  and  the  machines  destined  for  this  business, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  are  actually  blocked  in  Poland."  The  day  before,  Lier  had  sent  a  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">formal letter to Watson to allay any concerns: "On the occasion of my  visit to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin,"  Lier  wrote,  "I  also  settled  a  few  pending  matters,  such  as  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  blocked  in  Poland  [and]  the  Romanian  census  ...  I  am  addressing </p>
<p class="calibre1">separate reports to the executives concerned in New York."24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier  felt  that  if  only  he  could  contact  the  Romanian  Embassy,  diplomats </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  use  their  connection  with  Reich  offices  in  occupied  Poland  to  forward </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  machines  through  the  war  zone.  He  called  IBM's  best  contact  in  Berlin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S. Commercial Attache, Sam Woods.  'Thanks to Mr. Woods," Lier reported </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  IBM  NY,  "I  obtained  an  interview  with the  Romanian  Commercial  Attache </p>
<p class="calibre1">who immediately endeavored to obtain the freeing of approximately seven- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teen machines at present blocked in Poland from the Devisenstelle [Foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">Currency Office] and the German Authorities ... I have been given every </p>
<p class="calibre1">assurance as to the satisfactory outcome of this demand." Shortly thereafter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier did effect the transfer of Dehomag machines to IBM's Romanian </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  days  before  Romania  entered  the  war  on  June  22,  1941,  Marshal </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antonescu demanded lists of "all Jews, Communists and sympathizers in each </p>
<p class="calibre1">region."  In  addition,  all  Jews  aged  sixteen  to  sixty  in  towns  between  the  Siret </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Prut  rivers  were  to  be  rounded  up  and  immediately  shipped  to  a  concen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration  camp  on  already  scheduled  trains.  It  was  all  to  be  done  in  forty-eight </p>
<p class="calibre1">hours.  Half  the  eastern  city  of  Iasi's  100,000  population  was  Jewish.  Identify- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  victims  in  a  lightning  operation  could  have  been  an  impossibility.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antonescu's  Second  Section  intelligence  unit,  which  monitored  ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">groups,  relied  on  three  statistical  offices,  including  one  in  Iasi.  The  Romani- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ans  generated  the  names  and  addresses.  An  intelligence  officer  recalled  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Second  Section  was  crucial  "in  paving  the  groundwork  for  the  Iasi </p>
<p class="calibre1">pogrom  [in  that]  Junius  Lecca,  SSI  station  chief  [of  Iasi]  had  played  a  major </p>
<p class="calibre1">role by supplying intelligence concerning Jewish residences and centers."26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands  of  Iasi  Jews  were  dragged  from  their  homes,  many  still  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  sleeping  clothes.  For  several  days,  German  and  Romanian  policemen </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  soldiers,  as  well  as  wild  citizen  mobs,  perpetrated  unspeakable  violence </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  identified.  Corpses  began  piling  onto  the  street  as  Jews  were  merci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lessly  clubbed  to  death  with  metal  bars,  rifles,  and  rocks,  and  then  ceremoni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ously  spat  upon.  Infants  were  not  spared.  Thousands  more  were  loaded  onto </p>
<p class="calibre1">death  trains  where  they  would  be  viciously  murdered  in  boxcars  en  route.  As </p>
<p class="calibre1">many as 13,000 painfully lost their fives.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  late  1941,  the  statistics  on  Jews  yielded  a  total  of  375,422  Jews  still </p>
<p class="calibre1">surviving  in  Romania.  In  January  1942,  the  Wannsee  Conference  Protocol </p>
<p class="calibre1">listed  the  number  as  342,000  including  Bessarabia,  but  not  including  certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">other regions.28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  spring  1942  Jewish  census  showed  that  300,000  Romanian  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were still alive. On August 31, 1942, Antonescu reviewed not the spring data, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  the  late  1941  statistics.  When  he  saw  the  number  375,422  Jews,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote,  "a  very  large  number."  Next  to  Bessarabia's  6,900  Jews,  he  wrote, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Impossible!  My  order  was  to  have  all  the  Jews  deported."  Even  though  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bukovina  figure  of  60,708  Jews  was  about  a  year  old,  he  scribbled  in  a  rage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Impossible.  Please  verify.  My  order  stated  that  only  ten  thousand  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">should  remain  in  Bukovina.  Please  check.  This  is  fantastic!  Judaized  cities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply, purely Judaized."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  Septemher  1942,  Eichmann  had  readied  a  schedule  for  Romanian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railroads  to  transport  some  280,000  of  those  Jews  to  Belzec's  gas  chambers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  by  now,  Romania's  Antonescu  was  reluctant  to  cooperate  further.  Like </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  Nazi  surrogates  in  Ivistern  Europe,  Antonescu  feared  the  onslaught  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Russians,  and  rumors  circulated  of  a  forthcoming  war  crimes  announce- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  Jewish  bribes—including    100  million  lei  to  Antonescu's  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">physician—also helped. The trains did not roll.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  17,  1943,  Antonescu  again  reviewed  census  data  with  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">generals. "According to the latest statistics we have now in Transnistria a little </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  50,000  Jews,"  said  Antonescu.  Adding  10,000  Jews  from  the  Dorohoi </p>
<p class="calibre1">area  and  others,  Antonescu  tallied  "70,000  to  80,000."  General  Constantin </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vasilu  objected,  "There  was  some  mistake.  We  have  talked  with  Colonel  Rad </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulescu, who has carried out a census. There are now exacdy 61,000."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  end  of  the  war,  after  a  bloody  series  of  Romanian-German  exe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cutions  and  deprivations,  more  than  270,000  Jews  had  been  brutally  killed </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  starved.  Hundreds  of  thousands  more  died  in  bordering  regions  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania's jurisdiction.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  subsidiary  in  Bucharest  was  incorporated  on  March  4,  1938,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compania  Electrocontabila  Watson  with  approximately  $240,000  in  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  punch  cards,  and  leaseable  machines.  Quickly,  the  unit  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">profitable.  The  subsidiary's  main  clients  were  the  Communications  Ministry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">census  bureaus,  statistical  offices,  and  railroads.  Watson's  decision  to  incor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate  coincided  with  Romania  embarking  on  an  enhanced  war  footing.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">martial  program  would  include  massive  orders  of  Hollerith  equipment  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards.  IBM  Europe  was  unable  to  fill  all  the  leases  requested  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bucharest,  but  it  ramped  up  production  to  meet  the  need.  IBM  NY  was  kept </p>
<p class="calibre1">apprised of the progress.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Company  executives  had  worked  with  Romanian  military  committees </p>
<p class="calibre1">early  in  the  war  to  scrutinize  each  commercial  installation  in  the  country, </p>
<p class="calibre1">identifying  which  could  be  requisitioned  by  the  Ministry  of  War.  These </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  were  to  be  relocated  to  secure  sites  in  the  countryside  when  fight- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  broke  out.  Special  arrangements  with  the  Romanian  Ministry  of  War </p>
<p class="calibre1">exempted  IBM  supervisors  and  engineers  from  the  draft  to  assure  continuity </p>
<p class="calibre1">of service.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  months  after  Lier  arranged  the  shipment  of  seventeen  additional </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  from  Poland  to  Bucharest,  America  declared  war.  Shortly  there- </p>
<p class="calibre1">after,  Romania  was  deemed  enemy  territory  under  General  Ruling  11.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  needed  to  finalize  commissions  owed  to  the  Italian  bank  in  Bucharest </p>
<p class="calibre1">that covered delivery guarantees. Writing on corporate letterhead co-equally </p>
<p class="calibre1">displaying  the  name  of  IBM  in  New  York  and  IBM  Europe  in  Geneva  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">June 18, 1942, Lier tried to secure from the American Commercial Attache in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bern  a special  license to  pay  t h e   hank  commissions.  Lier  wrote,  "In  the  mid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dle  of  last  year,  our  Romanian  company  contracted  a  large  order  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian  census  authorities  for  the  execution  of  the  census  of  the  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  Romania.  Prior  to  giving  that  order  to  our  Romanian  company,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian  Government  required  a  bank  guarantee  to  be  filed  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Banque  Commerciale  Italienne  et  Roumaine  in  Bucharest  to  cover  the  deliv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ery  of  the  equipment  foreseen  by  the  order...  May  we  therefore  request  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  issue  a  license  which  would  authorize  us  to  cover  the  amount  of  Lei </p>
<p class="calibre1">111,348  by  remitting  this  amount  in  Swiss  Francs  to  the  Societe  de  Banque </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suisse in Geneva."35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  American  legation  denied  Lier's  request  and  suggested  he  contact </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Treasury  Department  in  America.  Lier  asked  IBM  NY  to  handle  the  mat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter directly with Washington.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  late  as  January  1944,  Schotte  in  New  York  acknowledged  to  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  of  Justice  investigator  Harold  Carter  that  he  knew  that  punch  cards  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Central  Institute  of  Statistics  contained  information  on  census,  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  trends,  and  "special  studies  of  all  minority  groups  in  Romania."  Schotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  confirmed  that  Romania's  railroads  maintained  "a  large  installation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines"  located  at  the  Ministry  for  Communications.  The  railroad's  Statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tical  Department  alone  utilized  as  many  as  1.7  million  cards  annually,  and  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traction  Department  3.34  million  more.  Those  cards  were  printed  on  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swift  Press  in  its  busy  Bucharest  facility,  which  was  functioning  at  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute capacity of 20 million cards per year.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania  was  liberated  from  domination  by  Russian  occupiers  in  late </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  1944.  On  September  2,  1944,  IBM  Bucharest  cabled  a  report  to  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva:  "Company  in  working  order.  Cable  instructions  for  changed  circum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stances.  Arrange  urgendy  protection  of  property  and  personnel."  A  second </p>
<p class="calibre1">brief  report  was  cabled  on  October  5.  General  Ruling  11  had  not  yet  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">lifted,  so  IBM  could  not  reply.  Lier,  on  September  18,  petitioned  the  Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  Legation  in  Geneva  for  permission  to  respond.  IBM  was  in  fact  the  first </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation  to  ask  permission  to  resume  normal  business.  America's  Com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercial  Attache  ruled,  "Romania  is  still  enemy  territory  under  General  Rul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  Number  11.  .  .  .  Until  such  time  as  General  Ruling  Number  11  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">specifically  revoked  or  amended  for  Romania,  the  International  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines Co. may not communicate with that country without license."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  Lier's  request  was  routed  to  the  State  Department  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">the American Embassy in London. "When a response was finally permitted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM, in its very first communication, answered, "Your telegram of the 12th </p>
<p class="calibre1">October seems to indicate that your present situation is normal and that you </p>
<p class="calibre1">are proceeding with your work as best you can. "39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company  then  asked  for  a  comprehensive  eleven-point  report  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  financial  statements,  including  profit  or  loss,  and  rental  revenues  by  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tomer,  for  the  years  1942,  1943,  and  1944.  In  addition,  the  company  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted  an  immediate  estimate  of  future  prospects  in  war-ravaged  Romania, </p>
<p class="calibre1">broken  down  by  machines  that  could  be  rented,  personnel  needed,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">spare parts required. New York also wanted to know if Romania had made its </p>
<p class="calibre1">quota:  asking  for  "points  installed  and  uninstalled  to  date."  This  way,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian  subsidiary  could  take  its  rightful  place  in  IBM's  Hundred  Percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">Club for outstanding performance.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania  was  liable  for  war  reparations,  including  $20  million  to  pay </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  claims,  £10  million  in  Britain  for  its  claims,  and  approximately </p>
<p class="calibre1">$300 million for Russian claims.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  late  July  1945,  IBM  had  lodged  its  own  compensation  claims  for  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">damage.  The  total  of  $151,383.73  included  $37,946.41  for  damaged  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.  It  also  called  on  State  Department  intermediaries  to  secure  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">bank accounts in Romania.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For IBM Romania, the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BULGARIA  RELUCTANTLY  joined  the  Axis  bloc  in  March  1941.  In  exchange, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  received  German  military  support  for  its  territorial  ambitions  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Balkans.  The  Bulgarian  military  occupied  Thrace  and  Macedonia  in  neigh- </p>
<p class="calibre1">boring  Greece.  But  Bulgarian  society—from  its  churches  to  its  government— </p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelmingly  rejected  German  anti-Semitism  for  the  nation's  48,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-integrated  Jews.  Under  extreme  pressure  from  Germany,  the  country </p>
<p class="calibre1">half-heartedly  issued  anti-Jewish  legislation,  but  deliberately  laced  the  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fessional  exclusions  and  property  confiscations  with  many  exceptions,  includ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing conversion.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgaria  did  everything  it  could  to  frustrate  German  plans  for  Bulgarian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry.  At  one  point,  when  German-pressured  regulations  called  for  Jews  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">wear  an  identifying  Star  of  David,  senior  Bulgarian  church  officials  thwarted </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  move.  Sermonizing  that  no  man  had  the  right  to  torture  Jews,  the  Metro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">politan  of  Sofia  arranged  for  all  so-called  baptized  Jews  to  be  freed  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">obligation.  When  that  measure  was  not  enough,  the  government  cut  off  elec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tricity to the factory producing the stars, claiming it was a power shortage.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann's office wanted the Jews deported from the beginning. But </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Bulgarian people were so opposed to the deportation plans that farmers </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  threatened  to  throw  t h e i r   bodies  across  the  railroad  tracks  to  stop  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">trains.  Nonetheless,  by  late  November  1941,  German  Foreign  Minister  von </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ribbentrop,  in  a  conference  with  Bulgarian  Foreign  Minister  Popov,  declared </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  the  "unalterable  decision  of  der  Fuhrer"  that  all  Jews  would  be  removed </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Europe.  As  an  "intermediate  step,"  Bulgaria  was  instructed,  the  nation's </p>
<p class="calibre1">48,000  Jews  would  be  concentrated  in  Poland.  The  method:  deportation </p>
<p class="calibre1">by train.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  subsidiary  in  Sofia,  formed  on  March  17,  1938,  was  Watson  Busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  Machines  Corporation,  Ltd.  Its  single  most  important  customer  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian  Railroads.  As  with  virtually  all  railroads  since  the  turn  of  the  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tury,  punch  cards  made  it  possible  to  efficiently  schedule  trains,  locate  rolling </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock,  and  deploy  boxcars.  Without  Holleriths,  it  could  take  any  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">railway  company  up  to  two  weeks  to  locate  its  boxcars  in  peacetime.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">wartime,  fast  deployment  was  even  more  difficult.  Using  Holleriths  at  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">major  stop,  train  authorities  could  schedule  within  forty-eight  hours.  For  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">reason,  whatever  part  of  the  war  or  the  genocide  that  ran  on  track  and  rail </p>
<p class="calibre1">was vitally dependent on IBM.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch  cards  cost  money.  In  spring  1942,  just  as  the  Bulgarian  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  had  cut  electricity  off  from  the  factory  making  Stars  of  David,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  also  froze  the  railroad's  payments  to  IBM,  forcing  the  money  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  blocked  account.  By  spring,  Watson  Business  Machines  Corporation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia  was  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy.  Unless  that  money  was  quickly  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leased,  the  company  would  be  compelled  to  close  its  doors.  Bulgarian  Rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roads  would  then  not  receive  its  punch  cards  nor  any  further  parts  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">service for its machines.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  2,  1942,  the  IBM  manager  in  Sofia,  Pavel  A.  Datsoff,  contacted </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier  at  IBM  Geneva.  "As  you  are  informed,"  wrote  Datsoff",  "we  have  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">receive  from  the  railways  the  rent  for  the  current  1942  year,  but  until  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  amount  is  not  paid  due  to  the  newly  created  conditions,  and  will  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">locked  up  in the  National Bank.  . . .   As  we  have  money  which  will  be  able to </p>
<p class="calibre1">cover  our  expenses  only  for  another  four  months,  and  if  in  the  meantime  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">do  not  succeed  to  arrange  ...  rent  from  the  Railways,  we  shall  be  left  with  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  for  our  rent,  salaries  and  other  expenses.  ...  I  beg  you  ...  to  open  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">current  account  through  Bank  Suisse  for  us  in  the  Italian  Bank,  as  it  was  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  past...  to  cover  our  expenses  to  the  end  of  the  current  year.  Otherwise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining  with  no  money,  it  will  be  necessary  to  inform  the  personnel  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">look  for  other  jobs  and  according  [to]  the  law,  we  must  notify  them  three </p>
<p class="calibre1">months ahead."48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  IBM  NY  could  not  fund  its  Bulgarian  operations  without  violating </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Ruling  11.  Lier  lent  Datsoff's  letter  to  the  American  consulate: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From  this  letter,  appealed  Lier,  "you  will  see  that  the  situation  of  our  Bul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">garian  company  is  jeopardized  by  the  fact  that  the  Bulgarian  Government </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  not  release  any  money  paid  by  the  Bulgarian  Railroads  which  has  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">placed  into  a  blocked  account  with  the  National  Bank,  and  that  this  money </p>
<p class="calibre1">served  in  the  past  for  financing  the  operations  of  the  Bulgarian  company  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do  you  think  that  there  is  any  chance  of  obtaining  a  special  license  to  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vide  the  Bulgarian  company  with  funds  . . .   in  order  to  avoid  its  complete </p>
<p class="calibre1">bankruptcy?"49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  American  legation  rejected  Lier's  entreaty,  explaining  that  monies </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  funneled  into  "enemy  territory  through  the  Swiss  Government  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  cover  the  minimum  subsistence  requirements  of  American  citizens  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  entided  to  receive  such  relief  payments."  Even  still,  the  legation  said  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  transmit  Lier's  request  on  to  the  State  Department,  in  case  Washing- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ton wanted to forward the correspondence to IBM NY.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  on  June  22,  1942,  the  Geneva  legation  went  further,  sending </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier's  request  to  Washington,  and  actually  suggesting  that  copies  of  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier's letter and Datsoff's financial distress call be passed to IBM NY.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwilling  to  wait  for  a  Treasury  license,  Lier  in  early  July  1942  urgendy </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  the  Geneva  legation  if  somehow  American  diplomats  might  convince </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Swiss  government  to  appeal  to  Bulgarian  officials  to  "deblock  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">account." Lier was again refused.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  record  is  unclear  exacdy  how  funds  were  funneled  to  the  Bulgarian </p>
<p class="calibre1">company.  But  IBM  Bulgaria  was  indeed  funded  and  continued  to  supply </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  services  to  Bulgarian  Railroads.  In  fact,  more  than  a  year  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  told  Carter  that  an  extensively  utilized  range  of  IBM  equipment  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">still  in  operation  in  Sofia,  including  a  vital  installation  serving  Bulgarian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railroads.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  15,  1942,  the  Reich  Foreign  Office  elected  to  delay  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">move  to  deport  Bulgarian  Jewry.  Foreign  Minister  von  Ribbentrop  scribbled </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  words  "wait  some  more"  on  a  report  summarizing  the  Bulgarian  situa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  By  the  end  of  September  1942,  however,  he  suddenly  told  Eichmann's </p>
<p class="calibre1">people to proceed.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgaria  was  unwilling  to  sacrifice  its  Jews.  But  in  January  1943,  Eich- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mann's  representative  arrived  from  France,  demanding  at  least  20,000.  So </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgaria  painfully  agreed  to  a  terrible  choice.  It  consented  to  the  deportation </p>
<p class="calibre1">not of its own Jews, but the 14,000 Jews in the territories occupied by the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian army - Thrace and Macedonia. Bulgarian Jewry was saved. Greek </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews would go to their death. Soon, the trains would roll.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  2,  1943,  the  Bulgarian  cabinet,  still  under  intense  pressure </p>
<p class="calibre1">from Germany, ratified the number of trains to be allocated. A few days later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  7,100  Macedonian  Jews  were  pulled  from  their  homes,  congregated  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">tobacco  warehouses,  and  later  marched  in  long  lines  through  the  street.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">women  wore  scarves  and  carried  small  bundles  for  the  journey.  The  men  car- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ried  larger  objects  on  their  backs.  They  walked  passively  with  helpless </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions  on  their  faces.  At  the  end  of  the  street  was  the  railroad  station, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian Railroads.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Thrace,  the  scenes  were  the  same  as  more  than  4,200  were  marched </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  boxcars.  Standing  before  simple  wooden  tables,  littlde  children  looked </p>
<p class="calibre1">up  with  uncertainty  as  their  parents  gave  their  names  to  men  in  black  uni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  jotting  on  note  pads.  Families  crowded  along  the  long  ramp  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  drab  railroad  building  and  the  trains  towering  above  them.  Finally,  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">busded  into  the  cold  boxcars  for  the  long  journey  to  a  place  they  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling  through  the  still  snowy  mountains,  creating  long  curving  lines </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  boxcars  and  catde  cars,  Bulgarian  Railroads  delivered  its  freight  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danube  port  of  Lorn.  From  there,  the  Jews  were  shipped  by  boat  to  Vienna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Vienna,  they  were  transferred  to  other  trains  en  route  to  their  final  desti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation, Treblinka.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  or  without  punch  cards,  efficiently  or  inefficiently,  a  determined </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  would  have  deported  the  doomed  Greek  Jews  from  Thrace  and  Mace- </p>
<p class="calibre1">donia.  If  locomotives  and  catde  cars  were  not  available,  Eichmann  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  ordered  a  death  march,  as  was  done  elsewhere  in  Eastern  Europe.  Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  Bulgaria  action,  river  barges  were  employed.  But  Berlin's  most  consis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tently  used  transport  mode  was  rail.  At  the  height  of  the  deportations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler  beseeched  his  Minister  of  Transport,  "If  I  am  to  wind  things  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly,  I  must  have  more  trains.  .  .  .  Help  me  get  more  trains."  Trains  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler's  most  valuable  tool—and  railroads  were  among  IBM's  most  lucra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive clients in Europe.59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">February  14,  1945.  With  the  war  over  in  Bulgaria,  IBM  Geneva  received </p>
<p class="calibre1">permission  from  the  American  Consulate  to  re-establish  relations  with  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  Business  Machines  of  Sofia.  As  they  had  in  other  countries,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  for  all  financial  records  for  the  years  1942,  1943,  and  1944.  Datsoff, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  manager,  was  asked  to  be  sure  to  include  a  customer  list  reflecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">"points installed and uninstalled to date" for review of Bulgaria's quota.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  29,  1946,  IBM  NY  f i l e d   a  w a r   compensation  claim  for  losses </p>
<p class="calibre1">sustained  by  its  Bulgarian  unit.  The  total  was  exactly  $1,000  including  $89  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">damaged  furniture  and  $836  for  "time  clock  and  typewriter  supplies."  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  also  asked  the  State  Department  to  help  it  regain  control  over  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">two bank accounts in Sofia.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For IBM Bulgaria, the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN  THE  NETWORK  of  European  railroads  that  delivered  Jews  to  the  Germans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian  Railroads  was  but  a  minor  player.  The  Polish  railroads  transported </p>
<p class="calibre1">millions  to  their  fate,  either  to  ghettos,  forced  worked  sites,  or  the  gas  cham- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bers  of  Auschwitz  and  Treblinka.  IBM's  subsidiary  in  Poland,  Watson  Buro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">maschinen  GmbH,  serviced  the  railroads  as  its  main  account.  Other  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  not  used  for  the  railways  were  moved  into  nearby  Maschinelles </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berichtwesen field offices or into Germany for service there.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  war  was  over,  IBM  NY  made  a  priority  of  recovering  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  and  assets  of  the  machines  used  in  Poland.  In  government  filings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company  listed  its  prewar  subsidiary,  Watson  Business  Machines  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ossolinskich  6,  not  the  one  it  incorporated  during  the  German  occupation </p>
<p class="calibre1">under  the  name  Watson  Buromaschinen  GmbH  on  Kreuzstrasse  23.  Nor  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  fist  its  print  shop  across  from  the  Warsaw  ghetto  at  Rymarksa  6.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  did  entreat  the  State  Department  and  military  liaisons  to  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">recover  its  bank  accounts,  including  two  at  Bank  Handlowy  and  one  at  Bank </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emosyjny,  as  well  as  deposits  in  a  post  office  credit  account.  Even  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland  was  liberated,  when  Polish  machines  transferred  to  Germany  proper </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  used,  the  Berlin-based  enemy  property  custodian  made  sure  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">leasing  fees  were  protected.  He  opened  an  additional  account  at  Deutsche </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bank to deposit those remittances.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  more  than  two  years  of  liaison  through  the  State  Department, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  straightened  out  which  of  its  machines  in  Poland  belonged  to  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  which  to  the  Polish  unit.  With  the  Holleriths  back  and  its  money </p>
<p class="calibre1">recouped, the war was over for IBM Poland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OPERATING  IN  Nazi  Europe  took  fortitude  by  IBM.  But  the  company  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">willing  to  provide  service  anywhere  its  Holleriths  were  needed.  Frequendy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  meant  working  with  regimes  that  tolerated  the  most  barbaric  renegades, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  doing  business  in  areas  subject  to  the  most  tempestuous  military  up- </p>
<p class="calibre1">heaval. Yugoslavia was an example. Germany and its Axis cohorts dismem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bered Yugoslavia into region occupied by German, Italian, Hungarian, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian  forces.    Hitler  also  supported  the  breakaway  region  of  Croatia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which was the scene of Ustashi tortures.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  local  conditions,  no  matter  how  atrocious,  were  always  put  aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On January  3,  1942,  for instance, the  New  York Times  prominently  described </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  horrible  bloodlust  underway  in  Croatia.  The  article  reported  what  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">termed  "'only  a  pale  picture'  of  the  ghastly  reign  of  terror  .  .  .  [where]  hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dreds  of  persons  were  killed,  but  before  they  died  many  of  them  had  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">ears  and  noses  cut  off  and  then  were  compelled  to  graze  on  grass.  The  tor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tures  most  usually  applied  were  beating,  severing  of  limbs,  gouging  of  eyes </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  breaking  of  bones.  Cases  are  related  of  men  being  forced  to  hold  red- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hot  bricks,  dance  on  barbed  wire  with  naked  feet,  and  wear  wreaths  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">thorns.  Needles  were  stuck  in  fingers  under  the  nails  and  lighted  matches </p>
<p class="calibre1">were held under noses."65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  area's  most  savage  concentration  camp  was  at  Jasenovac  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">unspeakable  crimes  were  committed  by  Ustashi  guards.  Jasenovac  was  situ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated on the Belgrade-Zagreb railroad line.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  any  horrors,  IBM  continued  its  thriving  enterprise  in  Yugo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">slavia, known as Yugoslav Watson AG. Before America entered the war, IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">NY  had  been  shipping  Belgrade  as  many  as  3  million  punch  cards  annually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1942,  the  German  enemy  custodian  appointed  IBM's  manager,  Vilimir </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bajkic,  to  remain  in  charge  of  the  subsidiary.  Bajkic  was  to  coordinate  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  military  commander  in  the  area.  Dr.  Veesenmayer,  Hitler's  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonal  representative  to  the  Dehomag  advisory  committee,  was  a  close  ally  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Ustashi  during  their  reign  of  terror.  Throughout  the  war,  IBM  cards  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulators  were  used  mainly  by  the  Yugoslav  army,  the  Ministry  of  Com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">merce,  and  Yugoslav  railways.  As  in  other  Balkan  states,  IBM  had  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements  to  service  the  military  machines  in  remote  locations  after  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">broke out.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  before  the  Russians  finally  overran  Yugoslavia  in  October  1944, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  of  the  subsidiary's  machines  were  hastily  relocated  to  German  territory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  to  the  nearest  MB  field  office,  or  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  Navy.  IBM's  people  in  Belgrade  forwarded  the  billing  records  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  before  the  Russians  arrived.  Hence,  the  Reich  could  continue  lease </p>
<p class="calibre1">payments  into  a  special  custodial  account  opened  in  Berlin  at  the  Deutsche </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bank.  The  Reich's  last  regular  payment  to  Yugoslav  Watson,  issued  April  3, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945,  remitted  RM  3,114.15.  On  April  20,  1945,  with  the  Red  Army  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">outskirts  of  Berlin,  the  enemy  custodian  submitted  a  special  invoice  of  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">51,970.24 for various services. Wehrmacht paymasters remitted the money </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  before  the  collapse  of  the  Third  Reich,  but  in  the  turmoil,  the  custodian </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  deposit  the  check.  Instead,  he  kept  it  safe,  and  later,  on  August  2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945,  handed  it  to  Capt.  Arthur  D.  Reed,  the  U.S.  Army's  Property  Control </p>
<p class="calibre1">Officer, for transmission to IBM NY.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  IBM  NY  needed  all  its  Yugoslav  assets  restored.  So  it  asked  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  and  State  Department  contacts  to  help  it  recover  eighteen  specified </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorters,  tabulators,  and  alphabetizes  moved  from  its  Yugoslavian  unit  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany;  serial  numbers  were  provided.  The  company  also  asked  the  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department to reclaim its bank account at Jugobanka in Belgrade.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For IBM Yugoslavia, the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN  THE  EARLY  morning  hours  of  August  25,  1944,  the  bells  of  Notre  Dame </p>
<p class="calibre1">began  to  clang.  Soon  the  other  churches  joined  in  welcoming  the  liberation </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Paris.  The  next  day,  German  POWs,  their  hands  atop  their  heads,  were  led </p>
<p class="calibre1">through the streets as Parisians celebrated their regained freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  6,  1944,  CEC  Director  Roger  Virgile  and  Sales  Manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gabriel  Lavoegie  were  arrested  by  French  Forces  of  the  Interior  [FFI].  No </p>
<p class="calibre1">charges  were  levied.  Virgile  had  worked  closely  with  Nazi  agents  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris  office  of  the  MB,  known  as  MB  West.  He  also  coordinated  with  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag's  custodian,  working  out  lucrative  leasing  arrangements  for  IBM  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines  transported  from  France  to  Germany,  occupied  Czechoslovakia,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland.  By  mid-1943,  CEC  was  holding  Nazi  orders  totaling  more  than  FF </p>
<p class="calibre1">38  million,  or  RM  760  million;  of  this  amount  FF  7.4  million  had  already </p>
<p class="calibre1">been advanced.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Virgile  was  released  briefly,  but  then  re-arrested  on  September  19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  with  CEC  Assistant  Sales  Manager  Pierre  Bastard.  Other  CEC  officials </p>
<p class="calibre1">feared  they  would  be  arrested  as  well.  The  American  Embassy  was  notified </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  an  urgent  cable  was  sent  to  Watson.  During  the  next  few  weeks,  efforts </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  obtain  the  release  of  CEC  staffers  were  unsuccessful.  Watson  was  kept </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  October  17,  1944,  William  Borel,  who  had  been  appointed  interim </p>
<p class="calibre1">manager,  wired  Watson  through  the  Embassy  that  IBM  staffers  were  still  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">jail.  "With  your  intervention,  we  sincerely  hope  that  the  company  will  soon </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  operating  normally.  Two  days  later,  Borel  cabled  Watson  again  that  key </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  were  "investigating  situation  which  appears  to  have  several  angles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything is being done to clarify the whole matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly thereafter, IBMers were suddenly released. Lavoegie resigned </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Virgile took leave from the company. No charges were ever preferred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  resumed  normal  business  by  November  2,  1944.  Even  though  General </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruling  11  was  still  in  effect,  the  subsidiary  began  sending  IBM  NY  copies  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">new orders through "various channels."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  a  year  later,  Captain  Gamzon,  a  Jewish  officer  from  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">resistance  was  speaking  to  the  United  Jewish  Appeal  charity  in  New  York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  UJA  was  raising  funds  to  assist  decimated  Jewish  populations  in  Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The New York Times reported his remarks under the headline "Jews in France </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saved  by  Others."  The  article  reported,  "Almost  all  surviving  Jews  in  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">owe  their  lives  to  non-Jews  who  risked  everything  to  save  them  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  when  they  overran  and  occupied  that  country.  .  .  .  Captain  Gamzon,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">former  leader  of  the  Maquis  of  France  .  .  .  told  the  delegates  that  it  can  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">said  without  exaggeration  that  any  Jew  now  living  in  France  has  been  saved </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  one  time  or  another  by  a  non-Jew—by  the  police,  who  made  believe  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  not  see  those  wanted  by  the  Nazis,  and  by  others;  many  of  them  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  who  furnished  false  ration  and  identification  cards  to  Jews  who  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">successfully  hidden  in  the  various  districts.  The  children  specially  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">saved,  he  said,  by  a  people  touched  and  saddened  by  the  deportation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire families."73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain  Gamzon  stressed  that  25,000  families  were  lost.  But  so  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  were  saved  due  to  the  heroism  and  sacrifice  of  the  resistance.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">saluted  the  men  and  women  of  the  underground,  people  who  had  been  tor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tured  and  deported  to  concentration  camps,  but  never  cracked.  Rene </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  was  not  there  to  hear  those  words.  Carmille  was  one  of  the  valiant </p>
<p class="calibre1">who died in Dachau rather than make the punch cards work.74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  took  more  than  a  year  of  petitions  through  the  State  Department,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  able  to  recover  all  of  its  French  machines  from  across  Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  it  secured  all  the  money  in  its  bank  accounts  at  Credit  Lyonnais. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  Holleriths  back  and  the  money  recouped,  the  war  was  over  for  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">France.75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">SWITZERLAND  WAS  the  commercial  nexus  of  World  War  II.  Its  famous  finan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial  secrecy  laws,  neutrality,  and  willingness  to  trade  with  enemies  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switzerland  the  Reich's  preferred  repository  for  pilfered  assets  and  a  switch- </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  for  Nazi-era  commercial  intrigue.  In  1935,  when  talk  of  war  in  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  pervasive,  Watson  moved  the  company's  European  headquarters </p>
<p class="calibre1">from Paris to Geneva. Doing business with Nazi Europe via Geneva involved a </p>
<p class="calibre1">constant  ebb  and  flow  of  inchoerent  blacklist  enforcement  and  acquiescence </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  American  commercial  attaches.  Deals  and  denials  characterized  virtually </p>
<p class="calibre1">the length and breadth of IBM's presence in Geneva.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murky  transactions  were  fundamentally  untraceable  since  they  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">filter  through  a  maze  of  banks  or  their  branches,  many  of  them  newly  created </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Germany,  scattered  across  occupied  and  neutral  countries.  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">branches  of  Swiss  banks  only  complicated  the  trail,  prompting  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  in  Washington  to  dispatch  squads  of  investigators  to  Manhattan </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking evidence of trade with the enemy.77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  even  reached  the  Treasury  that  IBM  might  help  establish </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  own  international  bank  to  link  Nazi  and  American  economic  interests, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thus  only  further  obscuring  Reich  transactions  and  financing  projects.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">early  1942,  the  Treasury  Department's  Monetary  Research  Division  moved </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly to block any such initiative. On July 13, 1942, Acting Treasury Secre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  D.  W.  Bell  took  the  unusual  precaution  of  contacting  Watson  directly  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">stymie  the  possibility.  Watson  quickly  declared  neither  he  nor  his  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  involved  in  the  enterprise,  directly  or  through  surrogates.  For  emphasis </p>
<p class="calibre1">Acting  Secretary  Bell  sent  Watson  an  extraordinary,  almost  accusatory </p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledgment  of  his  declaration:  "Treasury  takes  note  of  your  statement </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  International  Business  Machines  Corporation  has  no  knowledge  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  plan  for  the  formation  of  an  inter-continental  credit  bank  financed </p>
<p class="calibre1">jointly by American, French, and German capital. The Treasury also acknowl- </p>
<p class="calibre1">edges  your  statement  that  the  International  Business  Machines  Corporation </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  not  authorized  and  will  not  authorize  anyone  to  act  for  it  in  the  forma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of such a bank."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  added  this  clear  warning  to  Watson:  "You  are,  of  course,  aware  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  action  in  connection  with  such  a  bank  would  be  illegal  unless  done  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">conformity  with  the  provisions  of  the  Trading  with  the  Enemy  Act  and  For- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eign Funds Control."79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  snapped  back  to  Bell  with  a  rare  one-sentence  letter:  "Referring </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  last  paragraph  of  your  letter  of  July  13,  I  was  aware  that  the  plans </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  illegal  and  that  is  why  I  wanted  the  Treasury  Department  to  know  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">no  one  with  our  company  had  discussed  or  had  anything  to  do  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">proposition."80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  illusion  that  IBM  NY  would  not  receive  regular  reports  from  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  agents  about  the  most  detailed  operational  vicissitudes  was  contra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dicted  by  the  numerous  Monthly  Narratives,  quarterly  financial  reports,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  punch  card  requests  funneled  through  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Spain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and America's own diplomatic pouches.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly,  the  record  was  well  papered  to  protect  IBM's  legal  position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  1942  to  1945,  IBM  NY  would  wire  uncharacteristically  verbose  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">belabored  instructions  to  its  managers  in  neutral  Europe  to  repossess  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines,  stop  trading  with  subsidiaries  in  enemy  countries,  and  terminate  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracts  with  blacklisted  firms.82  Each  such  instruction  stood  out  as  a  veritable </p>
<p class="calibre1">disquisition  of  deniability  laced  with  highly  patriotic  rationales  for  obeying </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  law  against trading  with  the  enemy.  But  when  blacklists  arrived,  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  trusted  managers  in  Sweden  and  Switzerland  would  "get  strangely </p>
<p class="calibre1">busy,"  as  one  IBM  internal  probe  termed  it.  Or  managers  would  ignore  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York's  lengthy  tractates  to  stop  direct  trading  with  Axis  nations—sometimes </p>
<p class="calibre1">delaying  more  than  a  year.  In  the  case  of  IBM  in  Sweden,  a  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Justice  investigator  recorded  that  it  was  not  until  April  1943,  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  year  after  Swedish  manager  Tag  Lundberg  first  received  instructions  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">"cease  trading  with  the  enemy,"  that  the  wholly-owned  subsidiary  complied </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  an  explicit  order  from  New  York.83  In  many  instances,  elaborate  docu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  trails  in  Europe  were  fabricated  to  demonstrate  compliance  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite  was  true.84  Nonetheless,  the  true  record  would  be  permanently </p>
<p class="calibre1">obscured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  war  years,  IBM's  own  internal  reviews  conceded  that  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">respondence  about  its  European  business  primarily  through  its  Geneva  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  often  faked.85  Dates  were  falsified.86  Revised  contract  provisions  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">proffered  to  hide  the  true  facts.87  Misleading  logs  and  chronologies  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">kept.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  protracted  delays,  millions  of  punch  cards  would  be  hur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">riedly  shipped  by  IBM's  neutral  country  subsidiaries  to  enemy  countries  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">blacklisted  customers.89  At  IBM,  time  was  more  than  money.  Time  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards.  Once  a  million  cards  were  punched,  they  could  never  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">unpunched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  vortex  of  every  economic  masque  in  Switzerland  was  Werner </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier,  IBM's  European  Manager  in  Geneva  until  Germany  surrendered.  As </p>
<p class="calibre1">such,  he  was  the  company's  top  officer  in  Europe  involved  with  virtually </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  transaction  in  every  country  throughout  the  war.90  Yet  even  IBM's  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">review  at  the  time  concluded  that  Lier's  dates,  declarations,  and  documenta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion amounted to a prolonged and elaborate series of charades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  instance,  in  late  March  1942,  Lier  negotiated  contracts  with  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">blacklisted  Swiss  munitions  companies.  Yet  on  April  27,  1942,  Lier  sent  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable  to  IBM  NY  pretending  that  the  two  newly  negotiated  contracts  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually  signed  before  the  war,  and  then  openly  asking  New  York  to  petition </p>
<p class="calibre1">the U.S. government for a special exemption: "U.S. Commercial Attache Bern </p>
<p class="calibre1">requests  we  cancel  contracts,"  cabled  Lier.  "Can  you  intervene  to  maintain </p>
<p class="calibre1">installations on basil contracts signed before war."91 But IBM's own internal </p>
<p class="calibre1">review  later  confirmed,  "This  is  a  definitely  misleading  statement  because, </p>
<p class="calibre1">apart  from  the  two  contracts  here  under  consideration,  three  other  contracts </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  signed  by  the  customer  after  the  United  States  had  entered  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  war  .  .  .  the  machines  were  supplied  and  billed  by  Geneva,  and  payment </p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted.  Mr.  Lier  made  thereby  a  deliberately  misleading  statement....  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">deception  is  the  more  serious  since  none  of  the  contracts  signed  before  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war existed any longer."92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  also  found  a  pattern  of  falsified  dates.  For  instance,  Lier  sent  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">NY a cable July 21, 1942, asserting that a Type 954 Hollerith was installed at </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  blacklisted  customer  site  in  Switzerland  on  December  31,  1941.  However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  own  fraud  review,  citing  its  Installation  Report  No.  22,  proved  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  was  actually  installed  on  March  31,  1942,  with  rent  beginning  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">April 1942.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foot-dragging,  false  logs,  and  contrived  chronologies  were  common- </p>
<p class="calibre1">place  at  IBM  Geneva.  For  example,  Lier  had  created  an  extensive  log  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrate  how  he  regularly  complied  with  American  consular  officials  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bern  who  demanded  IBM  cease  business  with  blacklisted  companies.  Even- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tually,  IBM  had  to  admit  in  a  letter: "Thus it  has  taken  Mr.  Lier  thirteen  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  inform  Mr.  Herzog  [an  IBM  sales  manager]  that  two  of  his  customers </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared  on  the  'Black  List,'  when  he  [Lier]  could  have  informed  Mr.  Herzog </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  telephone  on  the  day  he  was  in  possession  of  this  information—namely </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  March  25  [1942].94  In  consequence,"  the  company  letter  continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[American  Commercial  Attache  Daniel]  Reagan  had  pierced  the  mystery </p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding  this  case  and  [refused]  . . .   to  accept  Mr.  Lier's  ..  .  chronological </p>
<p class="calibre1">report,  inasmuch  as  he  accuses  him  of  having  had  these  contracts  five  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">after he [Lier] knew that these customers were on the Black List."95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  occasion,  even  IBM  NY  could  no  longer  unravel  the  ruses  its  key </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers  were  weaving.  IBM's  own  internal  review  of  one  case  confessed </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  after  June  1942,  "we  lose  track  of  the  case  as  the  correspondence  relat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing thereto was withdrawn from the files."96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  IBM's  own  internal  reviews  summarizing  a  pattern  of  impropri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eties, Watson allowed Lier to continue at his pivotal post. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  himself  set  the  stage  for  IBM  Europe's  wartime  conduct.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">October  1941,  he  circulated  instructions  to  all  subsidiaries:  "In  view  of  world </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  we  cannot  participate  in  the  affairs  of  our  companies  in  various </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  as  we  did  in  normal  times.  Therefore  you  are  advised  that  you  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">have to make your own decisions and not call on us for any advice or assis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance  until  further  notice."97  That  instruction  never  asked  IBM  executives  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">stop  trading  with  the  Hitler  regime,  or  place  a  halt  on  sales  to  the  camps,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  machine,  or  any  German  occupying  authority.  Watson  only  asked  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies to stop informing the New York office about their activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  illusion  of  non-involvement,  IBM  NY  continued  to  play  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">central  role  in  the  day-to-day  operations  of  its  subsidiaries.  Company  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries  regularly  traded  with  Axis-linked  blacklisted  companies  in  neutral </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries,  and  even  directly  with  Germany  and  Italy.98  It  was  business  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">usual throughout the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  Swiss  national,  Lier  freely  traveled  to  and  from  Germany,  occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pied  territories,  and  neutral  countries  micro-managing  company  affairs  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six  months  after  Watson  declared  IBM  Headquarters  to  be  cut  off </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  its  overseas  units,  Lier  himself  defined  IBM  Geneva's  role  not  as  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">autonomous,  detached  office—but  as  a  nexus,  which  simply  implemented </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  business  decisions  made  by  IBM  NY.  On  April  29,  1942,  Lier  outlined </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the  American  Consul  in  Geneva  exactly  how  IBM  Geneva  operated.  "You </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  readily  understand,"  explained  Lier,  "that  this  office  is  a  clearing  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  the  local  organizations  in  the  various  countries  and  the  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Headquarters."  Lier  added  that  IBM  NY  made  all  the  decisions.  His  function </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  simply  to  monitor  the  business  and  keep  the  records.  "The  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">Headquarters in  Geneva," he  explained, "are,  in  a  way,  a  representative  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  Headquarters  in  New  York,  whose  job  it  is  to  manage  and  control </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  affairs.  ...  In  short,  the  functions  of  the  Geneva  Office  are  purely </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrative."100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier  emphasized,  "When  the  local  offices  require  machines  or  material </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  our  factories  in  the  United  States,  they  pass  the  order  to  the  Geneva </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  which, in turn,  transmits  it  to  the  New  York  Headquarters for  handling </p>
<p class="calibre1">and supplying the machines direct to the local office."101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  IBM's  business  philosophy  was  best  expressed  by  an  executive </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Beige  Watson  in  an  August  1939  letter  to  senior  officers  of  IBM  NY.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  detailed  the  company's  growing  involvement  in  Japan's  aircraft  indus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">try.  The  IBM  Brussels  executive  declared:  "It  is  none  of  our  business  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">judge  the  reasons  why  an  American  corporation  should  or  would  help  a  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eign  Government,  and  consequently  Mr.  Decker  and  myself  have  left  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">considerations  entirely  out  of  our  line  of  thought.  ...  we  are,  as  IBM  men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">interested in the technical side of the application of our machines."102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  as  European  territory  was  liberated  in  late  1944  and  early  1945, </p>
<p class="calibre1">re-established national authorities began to hold commercial collaborators </p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible. French arrests of IBM people in Paris - despite their ultimate </p>
<p class="calibre1">release—were  charaeteristic  of  the  liberation  fervor  gripping  Europe.  Lier </p>
<p class="calibre1">himself  had  been  the  center  of  many  rumors.  One  story  suggested  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  transported  Dehomag  money  to  Vichy  in  harrowing  nighttime  runs across </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied  France.103  Another  story  hinted  that  Lier  was  wanted  by  the  post- </p>
<p class="calibre1">War authorities even in Switzerland for bending the financial statutes.104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  facts  surrounding  IBM's  cloudy  dealings  in  Geneva  will  prob- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ably  never  come  to  light,  but  this  much  became  clear  at  the  time:  once  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  ended,  Lier  needed  to  disappear  from  Geneva  in  a  hurry.  Lier  had  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">choice.  He  could  only  escape  by  traveling  through  France.  So  at  the  end  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944,  just  after  French  intelligence  arrested  CEC  managers,  Lier  tried  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrange  his  immediate  departure  from  Europe  by  applying  for  a  French  travel </p>
<p class="calibre1">visa  at  the  French  Consulate  in  Geneva.105  But  on  January  3,  the  French  For- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eign  Ministry  instructed  the  French  Consulate  to  deny  Lier's  visa  request, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thus  keeping  him  where  he  was.  The  French  Consulate  took  its  time  inform- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing Lier, and only confirmed the denial on January 12, 1945.106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  even  if  Lier  could  leave  Switzerland,  commercial  officers  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  American  Legation  in  Bern  were  reluctant  to  grant  him  a  temporary  visa </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  enter  the  United  States  on  the  grounds  his  entry  might  be  "detrimental  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  public  safety."  They  expressed  themselves  in  an  exchange  of  correspon- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dence  on  January  16.  But  several  days  later,  senior  diplomats  intervened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  Consul  Paul  Squire  was  told  in  a  letter  by  legation  officer  J.  Klahr </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huddle.  "Supplementing  my  letter,"  wrote  Huddle,  "I  now  have  to  inform </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  that  the  files in  the  case  of  Werner  C.  Lier  have  been  carefully  examined </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  interested  officers  of  this  Legation.  After  careful  consideration  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">case,  it  is  our  considered  opinion  that  Mr.  Lier's  entry  into  the  United  States </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  a  temporary  visitor's  visa  would  not  prove  'detrimental  to  the  public </p>
<p class="calibre1">safety,' and it is believed that in your discretion you may act accordingly with </p>
<p class="calibre1">respect to Mr. Lier's application for a visa."107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  even  when  U.S.  officials  agreed  to  issue  a  visa,  Lier  still  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  enter  French  territory  to  effect  his  exit  from  Europe  and  travel  to  Amer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ica.  Yet  sometime  in  the  first  two  weeks  of  February  1945,  Lier  did  indeed </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly disappear.108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camille  Delcour,  a  longtime  French  IBM  director,  was  astonished  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">he reported to the Paris subsidiary on February 12. He penned a message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  coming  to  the  IBM  office  on  Monday  morning,  February  12,  a  notice </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  pinned  on  the  notice  board.  This  notice  informed  us  that  Mr.  Lier  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">on his way to the States, "a rapid means of transportation necessitating a hur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ried departure having been placed at my disposal" and that he regretted not </p>
<p class="calibre1">having the opportunity to take leave of the staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  is  surprising  to  us  is  not  only  his  strange  way  of  eloping,  but  how  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  found  his  ways  and  means  to  cross  France  since  we  know  for  a  definite </p>
<p class="calibre1">fact  that  the  French  transit  visa  for  which  he  applied  .  .  .  was  refused  to  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">on January 12, 1945. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seems  that  the  invitation  for  him  to  go  over  to  the  States  emanates  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Schotte.  Whether  this  invitation  was  extended  without  a  direct  provoca- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  by  Lier  is  uncertain.  I  am  cabling  Mr.  Watson  warning  him  not  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">guided by anything Lier  may say before a responsible N.Y. official has inves- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tigated the whole Geneva situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camille Delcour </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  could  understand  how  Lier  managed  to  escape.  As  late  as  sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mer  1945,  Bern  Commercial  Attache  Reagan  had  written  to  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy  reviewing  the  French  Foreign  Ministry's  decision  to  deny  Lier  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">right  to  enter  their  territory.  "We  have  since  learned,"  informed  Reagan,  "that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Lier  successfully  reached  the  United  States  and  we  would  like  to  know </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  he  could  have  traveled  through  France  without  the  necessary  visa.  If </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  have  information  about  this  subject,  I  would  be  grateful  if  you  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">inform me."110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  should  have  been  plain  to  consular  officials  in  Bern.  The  man  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switzerland  who  intervened  for  Lier  was  America's  Military  Attache,  Brig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen.  Barnwell  Legge,  an  experienced  hand  at  smuggling  people  into  and  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Switzerland.  Consular  officials  had  already  explained  in  a  prior  letter  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Legge  was  one  of  two  senior  foreign  service  officers  who  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">proffered  his  written  justification  for  allowing  Lier  into  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  other  was  the  Consul  General  himself,  a  man  who  had  transferred  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  German  Embassy  in  Berlin.  That  new  Consul  General  was  Sam </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woods—the  same  Sam  Woods  who  helped  IBM  during  Dehomag's  revolt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and who later helped Lier move Holleriths from Poland to Romania.111 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Werner C. Lier and IBM Geneva, the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">XV THE   S P O I L S   OF   G E N O C I D E ,    II </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN   WORLD   WAR   II   ENDED   IN   EUROPE,   THE   CONTINENT </p>
<p class="calibre1">was shattered and in disarray. Millions of all faiths and nationalities were dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  millions  more—displaced  persons,  tattered  victims,  and  fatigued </p>
<p class="calibre1">combatants—it would be years before they could recover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged </p>
<p class="calibre1">from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">years </p>
<p class="calibre1">with </p>
<p class="calibre1">relatively </p>
<p class="calibre1">little  damage  and  virtually  ready  to  resume  business  as  usual.  Its </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  had  been  salvaged,  its  profits  preserved,  and  its  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">value  protected.  Hence,  when  the  war  ended,  IBM  NY  was  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">recapture  its  problematic  but  valuable  German  subsidiary,  recover </p>
<p class="calibre1">its machines, and assimilate all the profits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As </p>

<p class="calibre1">government </p>
<p class="calibre1">concluded  that  Hitler's  Holleriths  were  strategic  machines  to  save, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  destroy.  Dehomag's  equipment  held  the  keys  to  a  smooth  mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  occupation  of  Germany  and  the  other  Axis  territories.  By  June </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944,  Carter's  investigative  reports  on  IBM  and  Dehomag  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">adapted  into  a  confidential  War  Department  Pamphlet,  31-123,  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tided  Civil  Affairs  Guide:  Preservation  and  Use  of  Key  Records  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  Over  several  dozen  pages,  key  government  and  Party  offices </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  listed  by  street  address  with  a  description  of  their  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  and  data.  On  page  18,  the  Ministry  of  Labor  entry  declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Their records are of the utmost importance as they are the means </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  which  the  Germans  controlled  and  shifted  manpower,  and  should  there- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore  be  a  valuable  source  of  information  for  the  occupying  authorities.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">pages  19-20,  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  entry  explained,  "The  up-to-date </p>
<p class="calibre1">reports  disclose  the  location  and  number  of  trains  available  in  each  territory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">traffic density, tonnage over a particular line, type of cars used, type of materi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">als  shipped.  ...  As  the  smooth  running  of  the  railroad  system  is  of  primary </p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  ...  in  administering  the  occupied  territory,  all  records  should  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">placed under military custody."1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  War  Department's  Civil  Affairs  Guide  citation  on  page  21  for  Police </p>
<p class="calibre1">Records  specified,  "records  on  aliens  and  Jews  are  kept  by  a  special  depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  of  the  police,  the  Fremdenpolizei  (alien  police).  ...  By  an  elaborate  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nique,  that  is  kept  rigorously  up  to  date,  the  police  are  enabled  to  trace  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">movements  of  practically  everyone  in  the  country."  On  page  58,  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gestapo  Card  Index,"  section  subsection  B  was  entitled  "Register  of  In- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mates  of  Concentration  Camps."  It  confirmed:  "The  Gestapo  Directorates  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offices  keep  the  register  of  inmates  of  concentration  camps  in  the  areas </p>
<p class="calibre1">under  their  jurisdiction.  Copies  are  to  be  found  in  the  concentration  camps </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves."2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Appendix  B  of  the  Civil  Affairs  Guide  identified  the  Dehomag  factories </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  summarized  the  operational  basics  of  Hollerith  tabulators,  sorters,  verifi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers, and multipliers.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">British  intelligence  was  also  keen  to  maintain  German  Holleriths  intact </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  facilitate  the  occupation.  A  British  paper  reviewing  the  Reich  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  asserted,  "If  the  German  statistical  staffs  at  the  Ministry  of  Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  at  subordinate  levels  continue  to  function,  it  will  not  require  a  great </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  people  to  take  charge.  If,  however,  the  German  system  .  .  .  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  disrupted  and  the  records  sabotaged,  it  would  be  a  long  and  arduous, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though necessary, task to reconstitute it."4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  forces  were  just  as  eager  to  safeguard  their  IBM  equipment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">albeit  for  their  own  reasons.  As  the  Allies  liberated  territories  from  the  east </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  west,  precious  machines  were  moved  behind  defensible  fines  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  continued  use.  As  late  as  1945,  der  Fuhrer  himself  had  issued  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">decree  placing  a  new  emphasis  on  punch  card  technology  for  registering  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking  all  Germans  needed  for  the  defense  of  the  Reich.  He  appointed </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karl-Hermann  Frank,  former  military  governor  of  occupied  Czechoslovakia </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  a  new  plenipotentiary  for  punch  card  registration.  Frank  would  be  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">supercede  the  authority  of  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen  (MB),  the  Zentral </p>
<p class="calibre1">Institut,  and  all  other  party  and  state  offices.  "In  this  capacity,  he  has  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">answer to me personally," declared Hitler. Der Fuhrer added that the commit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tee  advising  Frank  would  be  chaired  by  Rudolf  Schmeer,  the  official  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke  for  the  Party  at  the  original  1934  opening  of  Dehomag's  Lichterfelde </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory. Schmeer still enjoyed a commanding role at the MB.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  just  the  strategic  need  to  evacuate  the  equipment  to  safer </p>
<p class="calibre1">ground,  Hitler's  Holleriths  constituted  damning  evidence.  Hence,  when  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">centration  camps  were  abandoned,  the  machines  were  moved  and  files  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stroyed  to  obliterate  the  record  of  war  crimes.  In  many  cases,  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">devices  from  various  Reich  sites  were  not  redeployed,  but  simply  hidden  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  them  from  Allied  confiscation.  However,  as  the  Allies  closed  in  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin, military intelligence tracked many of the machines.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  major  MB  punching  operation  of  almost  100  Hollerith  machines  at  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendisch-Reitz  office  was  shifted  in  part  to  Otto's  Hotel,  while  its  tabulators </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  installed  at  a  nearby  casde,  and  the  remaining  devices  were  shipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  rail  to  Neudientendorf  for  reassembly  in  the  basement  of  the  Riesbeck </p>
<p class="calibre1">brewery.  Allied  forces  arrived  at  the  brewery  before  the  machines  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">activated.  Machines  from  Krakow  and  Posen  were  also  moved  to  sites  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neudietendorf.  Tabulators  and  sorters  in  Koenigsberg  were  thought  to  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  loaded  onto  a  boat  that  escaped  before  Allied  armies  arrived.  Hol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leriths  at  Hannover  were  moved  to  Elze.  Nuremberg  machines  were  relo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cated  to  Brauhaus  Street  in  Ansbach.  Tabulator  experts  at  Kassel  shipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  gear  to  Oberaula,  but  first  removed  several  small  components,  render- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing them inoperative if Allied forces discovered the systems.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  both  sides  trying  to  protect  the  Holleriths,  the  evidence  on  exactly </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  and  how  thousands  of  machines  were  used  was  all  but  obscured.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  particularly  the  case  in  concentration  camps  where  the  Hollerith  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments were generally dismantled before liberators arrived, even if some of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards, decoding keys, and telltale Hollerith transfer paper were left behind.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,  almost  as  soon  as  Germany  capitulated,  IBM  could  begin  the  process </p>
<p class="calibre1">of recovering its valuable equipment from frequendy innocuous sites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  money  was  protected  with  equal  fervor.  During  the  war,  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  IBM  subsidiaries  in  Nazi  Europe  to  continue  operating  in  a  reliable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">profitable  mode.  At  first,  the  Reich  appointed  a  temporary  enemy  property </p>
<p class="calibre1">custodian,  Dr.  Kottgen.  He  simply  re-appointed  IBM's  most  trusted  managers </p>
<p class="calibre1">in virtually all the territories.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  1943,  however,  the  Reich  Economics  Ministry  had  designated  Her- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mann  B.  Fellinger  as  custodian  over  Dehomag.  Fellinger  was  one  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's  most  reliable  and  commercially  adept  Kommissars.  In  WWI,  he  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">served as the chief Kommissar overseeing all other custodians of enemy prop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erty. In France, where Westerholt officiated as preliminary custodian at CEC, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kellinger  was  empowered  to  supersede  and  ultimately  replace  him.  Ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately, Kellinger's a u t h o r i t y  extended not only to Dehomag, but also to IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies  in  Norway,  Yugoslavia,  Czechoslovakia,  Poland,  and  France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  also  coordinated  closely  with  a  second  custodian,  H.  Garbrecht, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  oversaw  the  IBM  operating  units  in  Belgium  and  Holland,  and  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Home's  appointed  official  at  Watson  Italiana.  Real  estate  attorney  Oskar </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mohring  was  named  custodian  for  IBM's  property  and  other  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">interests in Nazi Europe.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  assuming  his  position,  Fellinger  immediately  re-designated  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">best  managers  to  keep  the  subsidiaries  productive  and  profitable.  He  only  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cised  one  IBM  personality:  Dehomag  Chairman  Willy  Heidinger.  A  four-man </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advisory  Committee,  including  Veesenmayer,  quickly  replaced  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Board  of  Directors.  That  outraged  the  combative  Heidinger  who  saw  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">power  suddenly  neutralized.  On  June  18,  1943,  Heidinger  wrote  a  long,  bit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter defense of his involvement with the company, going back to its inception in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1910.  His  diatribe  railed  that  Watson's  interference  had  been  the  cause  of  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">problems.  Dehomag  was  German  not  American,  he  argued,  and  should  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">be administered for IBM's benefit, but instead completely Aryanized.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Contrary  to  what  has  on  occasion  been  alleged,"  protested  Heidinger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"it  was,  therefore,  not  a  case  of  us  Germans  participating  in  an  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise,  but  rather  of  Americans  participating  in  a  German  enterprise  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  created  ...  I  have  been  blamed  for  many  other  things,  in  an  unfounded  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">partly  contradictory  manner.  Among  other  things,  I  was  told  I  was  merely  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">figurehead  for  the  Americans;  on  the  other  hand,  it  was  not  very  nice  of  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  act  so  aggressively  towards  the  Americans  now  that  I  had  waxed  rich </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  them.  The  opposite  is  true:  It  is  not  a  case  of  my  having  become </p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy  because  of  the  Americans,  but  rather  of  the  Americans  having </p>
<p class="calibre1">become wealthy because of me."12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further  undercutting  him,  Fellinger  ruled  that  the  company  was  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">longer  obligated  to  re-purchase  Heidinger's  stock.  Heidinger  would  have  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">doubtedly  pressed  claims  against  Fellinger  and  done  his  utmost  to  regain </p>
<p class="calibre1">control  of  Dehomag.  But  Heidinger's  battle  came  to  an  end  several  months </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  his  angry  apologia  to  Fellinger.  Deteriorating  health  eventually  won </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  over  the  indomitable  Dehomag  founder.  In  1944,  Heidinger  died  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">natural causes.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  Heidinger  out  of  the  way,  Fellinger  was  free  to  operate  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  its  sphere  of  influence  as  he  saw  fit.  In  that  vein,  he  was  far  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  an  inert  oversight  officer.  Fellinger  functioned  with  as  much  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">zeal and dedication to the IBM enterprise as any senior executive Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  have  personally  selected.  It  was  exactly  as  Watson  had  envisioned.  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's  custodian,  Fellinger,  was  t he   perfect  solution  to  the  Dehomag  revolt </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  predicament  of  a  business  alliance  with  the  Third  Reich  while  Amer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ica was fighting a war with Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Norway,  Fellinger  received  regular  progress  reports  from  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norsk's  longtime  manager,  Jens  Tellefson.  Fellinger  limited  his  involvement </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  "smoothing  his  [Tellefson's]  path  with  [various  Reich]  departments,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">especially  the  German  occupation  authorities."  When  machines  and  parts </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  no  longer  be  imported  directly  from  New  York,  Fellinger  arranged  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">imports  from  "Watson  Italiana  and  Dehomag.  Tellefson  purchased  the  Italian </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  German  machines  not  in  the  Norwegian  subsidiary's  name,  but  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">name  of  IBM  NY  to  preserve  the  American  parent  company's  claim  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">property  being  used  in  occupied  Norway.  When  the  Norwegian  company  ran </p>
<p class="calibre1">low  on  card  stock,  Fellinger  also  arranged  for  supplies  through  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper vendors.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  one  point,  Norwegian  saboteurs  used  explosives  to  destroy  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norsk's  offices.  They  hoped  to  disrupt  the  company's  in-house  servicing  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Nazi  labor  office,  which  coordinated  both  conscripted  and  slave  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anticipating  such  an  attack,  Tellefson  had  arranged  for  Nazi  records  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">moved  off-site  daily.  Nonetheless,  most  of  the  IBM  machines  serving  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor  office  were  crippled  in  the  bomb  attack.  So  Fellinger  approved  relocat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  IBM  office  to  a  more  secure  neighborhood  with  replacement  machin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ery.  This  allowed  IBM's  lucrative  service  to  continue.  In  Norway,  annual </p>
<p class="calibre1">revenues  doubled  from  161,000  crowns  in  1940  to  334,000  crowns  in  1943, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  declined  only  slightly  in  1944,  just  months  before  Norway  was  liberated </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  1945.  Fellinger  attributed  Watson  Norsk's  excellent  performance  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">"wartime conditions."15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  dismantled  Czechoslovakia,  Fellinger  allowed  Watson's  handpicked </p>
<p class="calibre1">director,  Emil  Kuczek,  to  remain  in  command.  Fellinger  was  pleased  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuczek  has  conducted  the  business  with  great  care  and  expert  knowledge </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  acting  conscientiously  in  the  interest  of  that  company."  He  remembered </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Kuczek "always acted in complete harmony with myself." The Czech sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary's  card  printing  capacity  was  doubled  thanks  to  a  transfer  of  printing </p>
<p class="calibre1">presses  and  paper  cutters  from  Dehomag.  In  turn,  the  Czech  subsidiary  filled </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  punch  card  orders.  A  number  of  Czech  machines  were  assigned </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  "German  railways  in  the  East."  Kuczek  accepted  all  machine  rental  pay- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments,  but  did  not  provide  any  receipts.  He  deposited  the  money  in  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">account  at  Prague  Kreditbank.  IBM  Geneva  in  turn  notified  Kreditbank  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuczek was permitted to freely spend up to 20 percent of the deposits to pay </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  ordinary  subsidiary  operations  such  as  s al ar i e s  and  rent.16  In  this  way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czech  operations  were  routinely  funded  without  any  written  instructions  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM NY, and service rendered with a minimal paper trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  worked  hard  to  keep  the  Czech  division's  profits  high.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">insisted  on  eliminating  discounts,  limiting  expenses,  and  even  added  a  bonus </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Kuczek's  contract  based  on  net  profits.  From  1941  to  1944,  Czech  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card revenue alone doubled from 2.6 million crowns to nearly 5.3 million.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  showed  equal  diligence  in  his  administration  of  the  other  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries  under  his  control,  such  as  Poland  and  Yugoslavia.  The  devoted </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver  never  failed  to  demand  the  best  terms  and  formulate  the  most  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">servative business decisions to protect the companies he administered.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  even  put  IBM's  interest  before  that  of  the  Third  Reich,  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly  badgering  Berlin  to  pay  more  rent,  and  clear  up  its  delinquencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  even  demanded  that  the  Wehrmacht  pay  for  CEC  machines  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  seized  from  occupied  France.  It  took  months  of  burdensome  legal </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrangling,  but  Fellinger  successfully  argued  that  the  German  military  had  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">right  to  remove  CEC's  machines  without  properly  compensating  IBM.  His </p>
<p class="calibre1">argument  hammered  away  at  the  theme  that  because  the  plundered  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">were leased items, they never belonged to the French government, but to IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  such,  the  transferred  devices  were  not  subject  to  traditional  rules  of  "war </p>
<p class="calibre1">booty."  Only  after  reams  of  Fellinger's  dense  briefs,  supported  by  attestations </p>
<p class="calibre1">by CEC Managing Director Roger Virgile, did the MB finally consent to nearly </p>
<p class="calibre1">a million Reichsmarks in back rent for machines transported out of France.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  when  308  leasing  contracts—one  for  each  requisitioned  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">—were  printed  and  submitted  to  CEC,  at  the  last  minute  Fellinger  asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">Virgile  to  withhold  signature.  Fellinger  learned  that  the  MB  had  negotiated </p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly  better  maintenance  discounts  with  the  custodian  for  IBM  units  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belgium  and  Holland.  Only  after  an  adjustment  guaranteeing  parity  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  finally  agree.  To  replace  the  308  now  obsolete  leasing  contracts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  proposed  reducing  the  entire  agreement  to  a  punch  card  but  won- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dered  about  the  validity  of  a  "punch  card  signature."  Ultimately,  the  parties </p>
<p class="calibre1">relied on traditional written contracts.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  engineer  Oskar  Hoermann,  who  doubled  as  CEC's  deputy </p>
<p class="calibre1">custodian,  transmitted  the  basic  format  for  the  308  leases  to  Paris.  During </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  war  years,  Hoermann  stayed  in  contact  with  IBM  NY  by  various  means, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including  posting  ordinary  letters—casual  and  formal—from  Vichy  France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  in  April  1942,  while  transiting  from  Berlin  through  Vichy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoermann  mailed  a  handwritten  "Dear  Jimmy"  letter  to  manufacturing  exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utives at Endicott, New York, routinely reporting factory developments at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  and  CEC.  From  Vichy,  Hoermann  also  was  free  to  communicate </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Lier  in  Geneva.  The  protracted  negotiations  with  the  MB  specified  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  hours  IBM  machines  could  he  used  each  month,  thus  limiting </p>
<p class="calibre1">wear  and  tear,  as  well  as  monthly  rental  fees.  CEC  managers  in  combination </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Fellinger  stubbornly  held  out  for  the  best  terms,  yielding  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  for  IBM.  Until  the  agreement  was  finalized,  CEC  was  willing  to  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">wait for its back rent.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  June  16,  1944,  an  MB  official  finally  noted  for  his  file,  "Fellinger  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">received  the  basic  agreement  signed  by  us  and  will  give  it  today  to  his  CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">representative,  Mr.  Hoermann,  who  is  currently  in  Berlin.  Mr.  Hoermann  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  it  with  him  to  Paris, where  General  Director Virgile  will  sign  it.  .  .  . The </p>
<p class="calibre1">essential  factor,  however,  is  that  after  four  years  [of  negotiation  dating  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the invasion of France], a basic agreement is being signed."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger's  counterpart  in  Amsterdam,  H.  Garbrecht,  who  administered </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  companies  in  Holland  and  Belgium,  exhibited  similar  assiduity  in  se- </p>
<p class="calibre1">curing  payment  for  machines  removed  from  subsidiaries  under  his  control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working  with  IBM  managers  in  Brussels  and  Amsterdam,  Garbrecht  finalized </p>
<p class="calibre1">contracts  that  were  typeset  into  a  formal  lease  contract.  Each  contract  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clared  at  the  top  that  the  agreement  was  between  the  Maschinelles  Bericht- </p>
<p class="calibre1">wesen  in  Berlin  and  "International  Business  Machines  Corporation-New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York"  through  the  German  administrator  in  Amsterdam  or  alternatively  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brussels.  Details  about  the  specific  machine,  its  serial  number,  monthly  rent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">permissible  hours  of  usage  each  month,  and  service  terms  were  typed  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  provided  spaces.  Although  the  numerous  contracts  were  all  executed  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">September  15,  1943,  rental  terms  and  fees  were  made  retroactive  to  the  sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mer  of  1942,  depending  upon  when  the  specific  machines  were  transferred </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Reich offices.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  contract  series  #091/1/0094/43  for  a  model  034  dupli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cating  alphabetizing  puncher,  serial  number  10167,  specified  rent  at  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">127.47  per  month,  retroactive  to  August  13,  1942; the  device  was  deployed  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  MB  field  office  in  Munich.  A  model  405  alphabetizing  tabulator  with  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">automatic  cart,  serial  number  13430,  cost  RM  945.76  monthly,  retroactive  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  26,  1942. Monthly  billing  tallies  were  generated  until  war's  end,  spec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ifying  combined  rental fees  at  such  departments as  the  Foreign  Ministry,  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Navy,  Luftwaffe,  or  Inspectorate  Seven.  None  of  the  contracts  executed </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  custodian  Garbrecht  exploited  IBM.  In  fact,  German  officials  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plained  the  hard  bargain  they  agreed  to  was  fundamentally  unfair  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Reich was liable to pay for any damage caused by war action.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With all the fervor of a Watson devotee, Fellinger also blocked any po- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tential  rivals.  For  exampe,  in  early  August  1944,  when  the  potential  competi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  posed  by  the  Wanderer-Werke  alliance  appeared,  Fellinger  challenged  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">patent  rights  in  Germany.  To  avoid  litigation,  Wanderer-Werke  was  forced  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">accept  Fellinger's  stringent,  almost  dictatorial  licensing  agreement.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  receive  a  4  percent  royalty  on  every  Bull  machine  imported  into  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  The  4  percent  level  was  expressed  as  a  temporary  wartime  royalty,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  increased  after  the  conflict  stopped.  Fellinger's  agreement  demanded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  will  inform  us  about  the  type,  the  number,  the  date  of  import  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">final  purpose  of  every  Bull  machine  imported."  To  further  hush  Wanderer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Werke's  presence  in  the  market,  the  license  agreement  stipulated,  "You  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  use  these  machines  for  advertising  purposes."  In  the  end,  Fellinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  procedural  delays  in  Germany  and  the  liberation  of  France  in  August </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944  combined  to  effectively  stymie  the  delivery  of  any  Bull  machines  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Reich.25 Thus, Dehomag's virtual monopoly was preserved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  the  devoted  administration  of  Fellinger  and  other  Axis  custo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dians,  Dehomag  and  the  other  IBM  subsidiaries  in  Europe  thrived.  Their </p>
<p class="calibre1">custodial  authority  stopped  when  Germany  surrendered.  It  would  be  a  long </p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucratic  and  uncharted  process  for  IBM  to  reclaim  its  property.  Fortu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nately, Watson could rely upon another column of support: the IBM Soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AMERICAN  SOLDIERS  in  Europe  fought  valiantly  to  defeat  the  Nazi  nemesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part  of  their  mission  was  to  take  control  of  German  facilities  and  seize  evi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dence  of  Nazi  war  crimes  and  collaboration.  Whether  the  target  was  an  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dustrial site, a bank, a military base, or a concentration camp, it was all enemy </p>
<p class="calibre1">property to be referred to commanders, and possibly war crime prosecutors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  among  American  forces,  there  existed  a  cohesive  group  of  men  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  common  identification.  As  former  employees  of  International  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines  on  leave  from  their  company  jobs,  they  affectionately  referred  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves as "IBM Soldiers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  framework  for  IBM's  continuing  bond  with  its  employees  at  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">began  long  before  America  joined  the  conflict.  At  Christmas  1940,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed  all  employees  soon  to  be  drafted  into  the  military  that  they  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  granted  three  months  pay,  up  to  $4,000,  while  absent.  The  money  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  paid  to  inductees  in  twelve  monthly  installments,  a  comforting  stipend  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the family back home while the men were in uniform.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making  it  clear  they  were  still  part  of  the  IBM  Family  with  careers  wait- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  after  military  service,  Watson  announced,  "We  shall  miss  you  during  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">time you are away, but we feel that your year's training will be beneficial to </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  physically  mentally  and  morally.  As  a  result  of  this  training,  we  believe </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  will  come  back  to  our  company  better  equipped  for  future  service  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM....  If  such  is  the  case,  you  will  be  given  an  opportunity  to  earn </p>
<p class="calibre1">increased  compensation.  We  want  you  to  know  that  your  friends  in  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  are  back  of  you  in  every  way,  and  if  at  any  time  we  can  be  of  help  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">you please let us know."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  U.S.  military  formed  its  Machine  Record  Units  (MRU),  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees,  or  those  IBM  had  trained,  became  the  backbone  of  the  elite </p>
<p class="calibre1">MRU  forces.  IBMers  also  commanded  in  other  key  areas,  especially  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrative  units,  where  their  experience  would  be  instrumental.  In  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">minds  of  many  of  these  men,  unswerving  loyalty  to  Thomas  Watson  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">devotion  to  IBM  was  completely  consistent  with  military  discipline  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">field  and  loyalty  to  the  Allied  cause.  As  a  result,  when  IBM  Soldiers  hap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pened  upon  Dehomag  equipment  and  factories,  they  did  not  see evidence  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  crime  to  docket  or  a  key  Nazi  industrial installation  to  capture.  They  saw </p>
<p class="calibre1">something  inspiring  and  beloved  that  needed  protection  and  to  be  returned </p>
<p class="calibre1">to its rightful owner. IBM's cause was their cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SOMEWHERE IN GERMANY </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thursday, April 26, 1945 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Mr. Watson: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today  I  received  your  letter  of  congratulations  upon  my  promotion </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Corporal.  It  is  impossible  to  state  the  wonderful  effects  your  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">gives  me  especially  as  a  morale  builder.  And  in  this  respect  I  feel  cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  that  I  am  speaking  for  each  and  every  one  of  the  fellow  IBM  Sol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">diers.  Your  letters  and  those  of  the  executives  received  by  us  go  a  long </p>
<p class="calibre1">way  to  make  our  lives  over  here  in  the  ETC  [European  Theater  Com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mand] a much happier one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seems  appropriate  that  today  I  should  receive  your  letter;  the  day </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  returned  from  paying  a  visit  to  the  "Deutsche  Hollerith  Maschinen </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gesellschaft"  in  Sindelfingen.  My  Captain,  a  fellow  [IBM]  soldier,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">myself  were  the  first  Americans  to  set  foot  in  the  plant  since  the  war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Dehomag  employees]  Mr.  Otto  Haug  and  Mr.  Wiesinger  were  our  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonal  guides  and  I  can  assure  you,  Mr.  Watson  that  I  felt  a  little  thrilled </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing  on  a  small  scale  what  I  witnessed  in  your  factory  at  Endicott  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  winter  of  1940.  The  entire  [Dehomag]  factory  is  intact,  spared  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">some unknown reason by our airmen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Sindelfingen, I found a sub-assembly plant with many parts on </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  and  in  very  good  condition.  Every  tool,  every  machine  is  well- </p>
<p class="calibre1">preserved  ready  to  start  work  at  a  moment's  notice.  ...  a  card  stock  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  a  million  cards  [is]  ready  for  shipment  plus  two  hundred  rolls </p>
<p class="calibre1">of paper stock, stored away securely in a properly ventilated cellar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Holzgerlingen,  six  kilometers  south  of  Sindelfingen  there  is  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">service  bureau;  two  tabulators  type  297,  one  multiplier—601,  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorters—080,  522  summary  key  punch  and  four  key  punches—016. </p>
