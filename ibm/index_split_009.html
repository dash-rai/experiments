  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">suited  for  functioning  as  an  alphabetical  register  since  the  cards  are  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched  by  name,  but  by  number.  Punching  alphabetically  is  possible,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  are  so  many  technical  difficulties  connected  with  it."  As  a  result,  Lentz </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared  he  would  regretfully  bypass  all  other  projects  and  concentrate  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  alphabetizing.  "I  will  now  have  an  alphabetical  register  made  that  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">contain  the  names  of  all  Jews  and  Mischlinge  [people  of  mixed  blood]  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">have reported for registering."68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  further  reduce  delays,  Lentz  declared  he  would  split  the  task  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">two: those Jews in Amsterdam and those outside the city. Since the areas </p>
<p class="calibre1">outside  Amsterdam  were  already  complete.  Lentz  promised  that  list  first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This  part  will  be  ready  about  mid-June."  If  on  the  other  hand,  Wimmer  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calmeyer  preferred  Amsterdam  first,  Lentz  could  deliver  that  list  just  slightly </p>
<p class="calibre1">later.  "If  you  would  like  to  have  the  names  of  the  registered  people  in  Ams- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terdam  put  into  the  alphabetical  register  as  well,"  he  stated,  "then  I  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  able  to  have  that  completed  by  the  end  of  June  or  in  the  beginning </p>
<p class="calibre1">of July."69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  30,  1941,  a  German  civil  occupation  official  summarized  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">on-going  overlapping  Hollerith  projects  to  Wimmer  and  the  many  technical </p>
<p class="calibre1">obstacles.  "Besides  the  already  constructed  and  to  be  constructed  registers," </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  report  described  "a  special  alphabetical  register,  possibly  with  the  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  punch  card-system,  for  all  people  who  have  to  report."  But  the  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  for  the  new  alphabetical  file  could  not  be  printed  without  a  careful </p>
<p class="calibre1">design  of data.  So, the  official  added,  his  office  would  first  have  to  determine </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly  which  punch  card  columns  needed  to  be  allocated  to  yield  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">desired  data.70  This  was  a  question  only  Hollerith  engineers  could  answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only IBM could print the cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  Central  Register  has  already  requested  the  material  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  for  the  construction  of  the  Hollerith  system,"  the  official  continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Repeating  Lentz'  warning,  he  told  Wimmer,  "The  Central  Register,  however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">points  out  that  the  [existing]  Hollerith  punch  card  system,  which  currently </p>
<p class="calibre1">assigns  a  number  to  every  processed  form  and  registered  person,  is  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">appropriate  for  the  compilation  of  an  alphabetic  register.  The  alphabetic </p>
<p class="calibre1">punching  is  connected  to  so  many  technical  difficulties  that  a  [quick]  change </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  system  towards  alphabetic  processing  seems  just  not  possible  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">practice."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  don't  deny,"  the  report  continued,  "that  this  [additional]  processing </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  persons  who  are  obligated  to  report  from  Amsterdam  (over  85,000  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sons), will greatly increase the workload of the Central Office, and it will also </p>
<p class="calibre1">delay the completion of the special registers."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  for  Wimmer,  no  time  could  be  wasted.  He  ordered  all  alphabetizing </p>
<p class="calibre1">projects  to  go  forward  at  full  speed,  regardless  of  the  difficulty.  That  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">priority.  Lentz'  devoted  efforts  prevailed.  By  June  14,  1941,  Wimmer's  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  received  ten  copies  of  a  completed  preliminary  survey  "of  all  persons  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  blood."  The  alphabetical  index  would  be  ready  shortly.  "Very  soon," </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  report  to  Wimmer  promised,  "we  shall  be  able  to  start  categorizing  cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  groups  through  the  Hollerith  method."  Now  that  the  Jews  were  almost </p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely  alphabetized,  demographic  segments  could  be  cross-indexed,  sorted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then called up by age, gender, and profession, all in alphabetical order.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The systemwas soon ready. In early June 1941, and Nazi Dutch resis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance groups detonated two bombs in Amsterdam. In reprisal, the Germans </p>
<p class="calibre1">took action against 300 Dutch Jews, as well as a number of German refugees </p>
<p class="calibre1">between the ages of 18 and 30. The Nazis relied upon Jewish organizational </p>
<p class="calibre1">lists to round up Jewish youth workers. British intelligence reports asserted </p>
<p class="calibre1">that when the number of Jews the Germans wanted fell short, additional </p>
<p class="calibre1">hostages were taken. A British intelligence officer, citing a Dutch Jewish refu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gee, reported the additional action this way: "The Gestapo came with lists, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from Standesamt [the Registry Office], carrying out searches in houses and </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking for Jews in certain alphabetical groups. On one occasion, they took </p>
<p class="calibre1">all the Jews whose names came within the alphabetical register S to V." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The British report added that all seized Jews seized were eventually shipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Mauthausen concentration camp, "and most of them also died" within </p>
<p class="calibre1">several weeks."74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By June 16, 1941, Lentz reported that his office had almost completed </p>
<p class="calibre1">the total registration of Jewish persons commanded by decree V06/41, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except for a few "stragglers." He added that his Inspectorate "will now begin </p>
<p class="calibre1">the registration of different groups via Hollerith method." Lentz wondered </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether the Germans wanted any specific Jewish population  segments </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorted first. "I can process and pass on information," he wrote, "in case police </p>
<p class="calibre1">services or German services urgently are looking for special groups, for </p>
<p class="calibre1">example, artists or dentists."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few weeks later, on July 26, 1941, Lentz notified Calmeyer that the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspectorate had established his  own priorities. Processing by age was </p>
<p class="calibre1">already underway. Next, he would tackle those of Jewish blood who had </p>
<p class="calibre1">served in the Dutch military. "It is my intention," assured Lentz, "after these </p>
<p class="calibre1">duties, to start with the control on the punching of Hollerith cards to </p>
<p class="calibre1">improve the coding of professions." He would need a few weeks to finish </p>
<p class="calibre1">these tasks if approved in that order. "I hope to hear from your side soon if </p>
<p class="calibre1">you accept this proposal."76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  a  month,  virtually  all  "stragglers"  had  been  found  out  or  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">come  forward.  By  September 5, Wimmer  was  about to review summaries  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified  the  exact  number  of  Jews,  broken  down  by  specific  categories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz  had  registered,  sorted,  and  tabulated  118,455  Dutch  Jews;  14,495  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Jews;  and  7,295  others,  as  well  as  19,561  mixed  breed  Mischlinge,  for  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">total  of  159,806.  This  included  700  so-called  racial  Jews  who  were  practicing </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roman  Catholicism;  1,245  belonging  to  Protestant  churches;  and  12,643 </p>
<p class="calibre1">with no religious affiliation.77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz reflected on his mammoth accomplishment while jotting notes in </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  personal  handwritten  journal,  entitled  Memoires  I,  Registration  of  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Source and Development):   "I rented a Hollerith installation," he penned, "with </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  the  professional  statistical  survey  has  been  composed,  which  satisfied </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Germans  very  much,  and  gave  them  the  convictions  that  my  opinions  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been correct."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  also  thanked  his  Nazi  overseers  for  their  recognition  for  all  his  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nical  achievements.  "I  would  like  to  express  appreciation,"  Lentz  wrote  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wimmer's  office,  "of  the  confidence  you  repose  in  myself  and  my  staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks  to  this  and  to  your  cooperation,  the  Census  Office  was  able  to  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trive ways and means of carrying out its often-difficult task. May I express the </p>
<p class="calibre1">hope  that  we  shall  continue  to  enjoy  your  confidence."  He  also  wrote,  "This </p>
<p class="calibre1">encourages  us  to  strive  with  utter  devotion  to  do  justice  to  our  slogan,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">record is to serve.' "79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  hastily  established  subsidiary  in  Holland,  Watson  Bedrijfsmachine </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maatschappij,  at  34  Frederiksplein  in  Amsterdam,  listed  impressive  numbers </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the first eight months of 1940.80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cash: $180,088.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accounts receivable: $495,692.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plant, office equipment, rental machines, and parts investment: </p>
<p class="calibre1">$965,803.00.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  subsidiary  reported  a  gross  profit  of  $116,651.90  for  its  eight  months </p>
<p class="calibre1">of operation in 1940.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  by  the  time  the  subsidiary's  profits  were  merged  into  charges </p>
<p class="calibre1">added  on  the  New  York  books,  including  $522,709.03  described  only  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Other," as well as Eliminations and Adjustments, IBM reported a net loss for </p>
<p class="calibre1">its Dutch subsidiary of $122,668.70.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  1941,  IBM  sent  Holland  132  million  punch  cards  from  America; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  subsidiary  was  by  that  time  operating  near  its  capacity  of  150  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards annually. Those cards were sold for $106,920.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten  days  after  the  census  ordered  by  decree  V06/41  was  fully  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">piled,  punched,  and  sorted,  Nazi  authorities  demanded  all  Jews  wear  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  star.  Again  a  number  of  Dutch  people  reacted  with  outrage  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">protest.  British  diplomats  reported  that  in  one  town,  when  the  burgomaster </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordered Jews to affix the star, many non-Jews wore one as well.87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  was  not  the  outward  visage  of  six  gold  points  worn  on  the  chest </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  all  to  see  on  the  street,  it  was  the  80  columns  punched  and  sorted  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  facility  that  marked  the  Jews  of  Holland  for  deportation  to  concen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration camps. The Germans understood this all too well. On October 2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941,  H.  Bohmcker,  a  key  Nazi  official  in  Amsterdam,  gleefully  wrote  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arthur  Seyss-Inquart,  German  Kommissar  for  Holland:  'Thanks  to  decree </p>
<p class="calibre1">6/41, all Dutch Jews are now in the bag."88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">FRANCE  EXCELLED  at  many  things.  Punch  card  automation  was  not  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Although IBM had been able to install several hundred Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">devices,  mainly  for  high-volume  military,  railway,  and  banking  users,  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">forces  had  in  large  part  confiscated  those  machines.  The  rest  of  France  sim- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ply  did  not  possess  the  punch  card  orientation  of  many  other  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries,  such  as  Holland  and  Germany.  IBM  learned  early  that  its  brand </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  technologic  change  came  slowly  to  some  markets.  France  was  a  prime </p>
<p class="calibre1">example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland's  census  and  registration  projects  were  masterminded  by  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">fanatical  population  registrar  commanding  hundreds  of  advanced  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">still  intact  in  a  well-entrenched  Hollerith  infrastructure  supplied  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">decamillions of punch cards flowing from IBM NY and other European sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries. Decades of Dutch registration that had innocently recorded religion </p>
<p class="calibre1">and personal details could, under Lentz, be centralized into a clenching </p>
<p class="calibre1">social dragnet.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  France  lacked  a  tradition  of  census  taking  that  identified  religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henri  Bunle,  chief  of  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  France,  explained  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vichy  collaborators  on  March  4,  1941:  "The  General  Statistics  Office  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  is  not  in  a  position  to  rectify  published  numbers  as  the  last  religious </p>
<p class="calibre1">census  in  our  country  was  undertaken  in  1872.  Since  that  date,  the  individual </p>
<p class="calibre1">questionnaires  used  for  counting  have  never  touched  upon  questions  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">religion  of  those  counted."  Later,  on  April  12,  1941,  he  informed  the  newly </p>
<p class="calibre1">established  General  Commission  for  Jewish  Questions  (GCJQ):  "France  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually  the  only  country  in  Europe,  or  almost,  where  the  number  of  Jews  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  population  is  unknown,  not  to  mention  their  age  statistics,  nationalities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">professional  affiliations,  etc."90  It  was  common  to  proclaim  that  no  one  really </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew how many Jews lived in either France or even Paris.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inexorably  complicating  identification  was  a  confusing  patchwork  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">geopolitical  social  realities.  Since  the  rise  of  Hitler  in  1933,  masses  of  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fugees  had  been  streaming  in  and  out  of  France.  In  some  cases,  some  mem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bers  of  refugee  families  remained  while  others  in  the  group  relocated.  Most </p>
<p class="calibre1">estimated  that  there  were  hundreds  of  thousands  of  undocumented  refugees </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  foreign-born  Jews  in  France  when  Germany  invaded  in  1940. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alter France was bifurcated into an Occupied Zone in the north, including </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris and the Unoccupied Zone in the south, which became the Vichy col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">laborationist  regime, thousands of Jewish families in the north flocked to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vichy  for  safety.  In  some  cases,  German  forces  in  the  north  actually  expelled </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  to  Vichy  as  a  preliminary  measure,  much  as  Jews  were  expelled  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland  before  the  Reich  invaded.  During  spring  and  summer  1940,  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">things  setded  down  in  the  north,  thousands  of  families  cautiously  ventured </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  to  look  after  their  businesses,  possessions,  or  family  members  left </p>
<p class="calibre1">behind.  Jews  routinely  returned  to  Paris  as  late  as  November  1940.  During </p>
<p class="calibre1">May  1941,  special  trains  transported  8,000  Jews  from  Vichy  back  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">north.  Undeniably,  Jews  were  constandy  on  the  move  between  the  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  zones.  Addresses  changed  constantly.  No  one  knew  how  many  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">migrating Jews were foreign or native born.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  either  French  territory,  many  of  the  Jews,  whether  stationary  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">migrating,  did  not  identify  with  Judaism,  or  hid  their  religious  background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  genuinely  doubted  their  lineage  would  qualify  under  the  Reich's  rule </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  Jewish  grandparents.  Who  could  even  trace  or  identify  one's  ancestry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">especially  if  earlier  generations  hailed  from  outside  France?  Ambiguities </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  dimensions  of  Jewish  existence  in  France  persisted  even  as  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  reacted  to  looming  anti-Jewish  measures  by  openly  attending  syna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gogues.  There  was  no  way  to  quantify  the  number  of  Jews  in  France  or  gen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eralize about their character.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  problems  of  ancestral  tracking,  shifting  addresses,  and  other  popu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lation  uncertainties  were  only  multiplied  by  the  twin  French  jurisdictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  anti-Jewish  measures  were  executed  in  one  zone  and  not  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">other.  Sometimes  such  measures  were  enacted  months  apart,  or  with  vastly </p>
<p class="calibre1">differing  tenets.  Aryanization  of  Jewish  business,  for  example,  was  decreed </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  October  24,  1940,  in  Occupied  France;  the  similar  decree  in  Vichy  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  issued  until  ten  months  later,  August  27,  1941.  Adding  in  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  and  social  existence  in  French  colonies  such  as  Morocco  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Algeria,  and  making  special  provisions  for  the  uniqueness  of  Paris  itself,  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">further muddied the ability to promulgate and enforce actions.94 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  could  overcome  much  of  the  geographical  and  ethnic  confusion </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  France  if  it  had  enjoyed  the  regimented  cooperation  of  its  collaborators, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  reluctant  or  eager.  However,  for  many  leaders  in  Vichy  France,  will- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ful  collaboration  with  the  Reich  was  strained  through  a  French  rightist </p>
<p class="calibre1">mindset,  which  in  many  ways  mimicked  the  early  days  of  the  Hitler  move- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  In  the  beginning  phases  of  Nazism,  foreign  Jews  in  Germany,  so- </p>
<p class="calibre1">called Eastern Jews, were targeted first and foremost. In Nazi Germany, </p>
<p class="calibre1">German Jews who fought for the Reich in WWI were i n i t i a l l y  afforded spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial  status.  So  too,  the  French  right  wing  conceptualized  foreign  Jews,  espe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cially  refugees,  as  France's  scourge.  By  this  ultra-patriotic  French  thinking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jews  chiefly  deserving  of  brutal  persecution  were  not  the  established </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  of  France,  and  especially  not  those  who  had  distinguished  themselves </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  great  national  service.  War  veterans  and  even  those  contributing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">France's  cultural  and  scientific  realms  were  worthy  of  special  consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  do  otherwise  could  be  seen  by  French  rightists  as  an  encroachment  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">certain French prerogatives.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  less  a  Vichy  commander  than  Admiral  Francois  Darlan,  vice  prime </p>
<p class="calibre1">minister  of  Vichy  with  direct  oversight  of  the  anti-Jewish  bureaus,  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">quoted  as  telling  his  Cabinet:  "The  stateless  Jews  who,  for  the  past  15  years </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  invaded  our  country  do  not  interest  me.  But  the  others,  the  good  old </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  Jews,  are  entitled  to  all  the  protection  that  we  can  give  them:  I  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  some  of  them  in  my  family."  Hence,  a  long  list  of  special  exemptions </p>
<p class="calibre1">crept  into  the  official  French  enforcement  of  anti-Semitic  statutes,  on  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">side of the Vichy line.96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  in  both  zones  quickly  learned  that  their  anti-Jewish  collabora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  would  be  dealt  with  when  France  was  liberated.  As  early  as  November </p>
<p class="calibre1">11,  1940,  the  leader  of  Free  French  forces,  Charles  DeGaulle,  issued  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">surrogates  in  Vichy  a  warning:  "Be  assured  .  .  .  the  cruel  decrees  directed </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  French  Jews  can  and  will  have  no  validity  in  Free  France.  These </p>
<p class="calibre1">blows  are  no  less  a  blow  against  the  honor  of  France  than  they  are  an  injus- </p>

<p class="calibre1">Oppressive  Nazi  rule  could  have  dictated  its  iron  will  to  all  reluctant </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  authorities,    and    conquered  the    demographic  uncertainties    of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  Jewry  in  two  zones  if  only  the  Holleriths  could  be  deployed.  That  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  what  Holleriths  brought  to  any  problem—organization  where  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  disorder  and  tabular  certainty  where  there  was  confusion.  The  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  have  punch-carded  the  Jews  of  France  into  the  same  genocidal  sce- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nario  in  force  elsewhere,  including  Holland.  But  in  the  aftermath  of  the  MB's </p>
<p class="calibre1">technologic  ravages,  France's  punch  card  infrastructure  was  simply  incapable </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  supporting  the  massive  series  of  programs  Berlin  required.  Even  if  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  could  have  been  gathered,  transferred,  or  built—CEC  just  didn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">have the punch cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  had  openly  reported  to  IBM  NY  about  its  inability  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941  and  1942  to  locate  a  dependable  paper  supply.  Even  with  its  reduced </p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  load,  CEC  clients  required  50  tons  of  paper  monthly.  But  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  subsidiary's  deliveries  were  generally  rationed  to  as  little  as  15  tons </p>
<p class="calibre1">per  month—a  mere  ten-day  supply.  The  Reich  was  diverting  the  bulk  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cellulose  needed  for  pulping  into  nitro-cellulose  at  explosive  plants  through- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  France.  On  January  1,  1942,  CEC's  punch  card  paper  stocks  totaled  318 </p>
<p class="calibre1">tons.  One  year  later,  CEC  informed  IBM  NY  that  the  on-hand  inventory  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">dwindled  to  just  222  tons,  of  which  only  71  tons  were  from  a  paper  mill  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  reliably  produce  the  high-tech  stock  tabulators  required;  the  remain- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  151  tons  had  come  from  a  new  and  untested  vendor.  Bad  paper  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">jammed Holleriths, worsening the situation.98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  wonder  CEC  blundy  informed  IBM  NY,  "The  oudook  was  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">dark  ...  we  tried  to  obtain  paper  by  all  available  means."  Only  by  scraping </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  barrels  of  substitute  suppliers  could  CEC  "live  under  the  most  drastic </p>
<p class="calibre1">[paper] restrictions, which we imposed on our customers."99 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  September  1940,  just  after  German  forces  transferred  hundreds  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  Holleriths  to  the  Greater  Reich,  the  first  census  was  ordered  in  Occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pied France.100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  months  and  war  years  to  come,  exactly  which  censuses  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken,  by  whom,  and  by  what  method,  would  constitute  a  maze  of  mysteries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">befuddling  all  in  France  and  Germany.  Registrations  and  census  efforts </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  announced  and  scheduled,  and  then  delayed  and  rescheduled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  would  take  place  over  a  period  of  months,  but  often  the  deadlines </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  extended  because  the  results  were  so  incomplete.  Some  counting </p>
<p class="calibre1">efforts  were  undertaken  just  in  Vichy,  some  just  in  Occupied  France,  some  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">both.  Many  campaigns  counted  Jews;  many  counted  the  entire  French  popu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lation.  Most  were  executed  by  a  myriad  of  ad  hoc  census  styles  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">inept  to  the  diligent.  Incomplete,  inaccurate,  and  inconsistent  data  ruled  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  enterprise.  Heads  of  households  were  often  counted  instead  of  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">families.  Children  were  often  not  included.  Addresses  were  not  infrequendy </p>
<p class="calibre1">omitted.  Confused  officials  were  on  occasion  forced  to  admit  they  simply  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">no idea where many of the Jews of France were.101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  wonder  the  Prefect  of  Tarn  complained  in  a  December  22,  1941,  let- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter  to  the  General  Commission  for  Jewish  Questions,  or  GCJQ,  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">results  of  the  census  ordered  just  months  earlier  were  already  obsolete  since </p>
<p class="calibre1">the method did not systematically record changes of address.102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A later census inspector's report summarizing a major inquiry into the </p>
<p class="calibre1">head-count  of  eight  provinces  concluded:  "If  it  was  needed,  this  work  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">proof  that  the  census  of  Jews  prescribed  by  the  June  2,  1941  law  was  poorly </p>
<p class="calibre1">done ... a new census is necessary."103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  mushrooming  labor  needs  only  intensified  the  counting </p>
<p class="calibre1">havoc.  By  1942,  Berlin  had  demanded  as  many  as  600,000  French  conscript </p>
<p class="calibre1">laborers  under  a  strict  recruitment  schedule  as  the  requirements  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  war  work  changed.  In  October  1942,  the  Reich  demanded  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver  35,000  of  its  railway  workers  for  assignments  in  Germany.  Earlier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  had  suggested  the  release  of  50,000  French  prisoners  of  war  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">exchange  for  150,000  skilled  workers.  Recruitment  projects  required  waves </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  age-specific  worker  registrations.  One  labor  census  ordered  all  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">men  and  women  between  the  ages  of  18  and  50,  plus  anyone  working  less </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  thirty  hours  per  week,  to  register.  A  second  survey  sought  unmarried </p>
<p class="calibre1">women  between  the  ages  of  21  and  35  by  professional  category.  Yet  another </p>
<p class="calibre1">sought  to  immediately  register  all  young  men  in  a  major  youth  movement </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  the  age  of  21.  All  three  census  and  registration  programs  were  ordered </p>
<p class="calibre1">within  weeks  during  fall  1942.104  Dozens  more,  equally  disorganized,  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">undertaken during the occupation years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  new  census  program  would  be  launched  before  the  previous  one  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">completed.  Germany  was  of  course  accustomed  to  multiple,  overlapping  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus and registration programs, but only because it could organize them with </p>
<p class="calibre1">battalions of card punchers and fleets of Holleriths fed by endless IBM cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those simply did not exist in France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cascading  chaos  as  Germany  sought  to  count  Jews  and  others  in  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">ensured  that  the  multifarious  census  and  registration  efforts  would  not  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  misreported,  misunderstood,  and  mishandled  throughout  the  war  years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but would be misinterpreted for decades after liberation as well.105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fundamental cause of France's profound counting disarray arose from </p>
<p class="calibre1">its decentralized, almost anarchic, registration infrastructure. Registration </p>
<p class="calibre1">was not implemented by professional statisticians or experienced census </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices. With no one to do the job properly, Germany assigned it to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation's police departments, the prefectures. That stood to reason, since </p>
<p class="calibre1">police departments for years were accustomed to registering refugee Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">who entered their jurisdiction. Each prefecture executed its own count in its </p>
<p class="calibre1">own way, employing its own interpretations, and not always using the same </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms as the next prefecture. They did not use punch cards, but small col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ored pieces of paper and index cards. The machines they utilized were not </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM Holleriths whirring at great speed, but Remington typewriters with </p>
<p class="calibre1">sticking keys that constantly broke down. Pen and pencil were readily used </p>
<p class="calibre1">when typing ribbon was not avai l abl e.10 6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  real  effort  to  systematically  count  French  Jews  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">rumored  since  the  summer,  but  was  finally  announced  in  late  September </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940.  Jews  in  the  Occupied  Zone  were  ordered  to  register  with  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  their  businesses  at  police  stations  on  specified  days,  according  to  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabetical sequence. The entire process was to take eighteen days.107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  numerical  tally  for  the  Seine  province,  including  Paris,  was  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ported  as  149,734;  of  these,  85,664  were  categorized  as  French  nationals  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">64,070  foreign  born.  The  northern  Jewish  group  registered  approximately </p>
<p class="calibre1">11,000 Jewish businesses as well. Outside the Paris area, an additional </p>
<p class="calibre1">20,000 Jews were counted. These numbers were for the Occupied Zone </p>
<p class="calibre1">only.108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  one  thing  to  count  the  Jews  numerically  even  if  the  count  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">approximate.  It  was  quite  another  to  track  them  month  in  and  month  out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  organize  them  centrally  for  either  ghettoization  or  deportation.  With  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith,  that  diverse  information  would  be  sorted,  tallied,  and  summarized </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  yield  the  desired  results.  But  rather  than  compile  information  in  succinct </p>
<p class="calibre1">automated  tabulated  results,  French  information  was  segmented  into  a  series </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  traditional  paper  forms:  yellow,  beige,  white,  and  red—often  as  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  five  forms  to  complete  a  single  personal  file.  The  forms,  which  came </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  use  in  January  1941,  were  known  as  Tulard  files,  named  for  the  Vichy </p>
<p class="calibre1">police  bureaucrat  Andre  Tulard,  stationed  in  Paris.  Quickly,  the  Tulard  file </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  famous  within  French  authoritarian  circles,  which,  under  the  circum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stances,  seemed  the  best  means  of  tracking  Jews.  Soon,  the  Tulard  system, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  had  first  been  implemented  in  the  Occupied  Zone,  was  adopted  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vichy as well.109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike  a  Hollerith,  which  proofed  and  verified  all  its  information  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid  errors,  the  Tulard  system  had  no  method  of  automatically  deleting </p>
<p class="calibre1">duplications.  After  the  October  1940  counts  for  the  Occupied  Zone,  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  newspapers  began  extrapolating  the  raw  numbers  for  all  of  France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  4,  1941,  Bunle,  head  of  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  France, </p>
<p class="calibre1">advocated  another  national  census.  "Certain  newspapers  have  recently  pub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lished  fanciful  evaluations  of  the  numbers  of  Jews  in  France,"  Bunle  wrote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"These  very  exaggerated  evaluations  equal  several  times  the  actual  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jews in the territory."110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  a  second  major  census  was  launched  on  June  14,  1941.  This  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">covered both zones, counting 287,962 Jews in 87 of France's 90 geographic </p>
<p class="calibre1">"departments."  German  forces  oversaw  the  count  in  Occupied  France.  Vichy </p>
<p class="calibre1">performed the function in the south.111 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Jewish catalog that emerged required six pages of instructions </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent  to  the  police  prefectures.  Each  multi-card  file  would  be  marked  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">various letters: J for Jewish; NJ for non-Jewish, or for someone cleared of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  ancestry;  N  for  nationality;  D  for  domicile  information;  and  P  for  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">professional details. Multiple manual catalogs were set up for foreign Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  French-born  Jews.  One  whole  card  was  designated  just  to  record  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">woman's maiden name.112 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion and lack of preparation were everywhere. A May 15 letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the General Commission on Jewish Questions to the Attorney General </p>
<p class="calibre1">tautologically clarified, "If a Jew has not declared equipment for use in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">practice of his profession, this constitutes a non-declaration of goods." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another explanatory letter from the GCJQ, on June 24, 1941, confirmed to </p>
<p class="calibre1">an inquiring government official that the census laws simply did not apply to </p>
<p class="calibre1">certain colonial territories. On July 9, the GCJQ informed the President of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Council that it extended the June 14 census deadline "because the pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fectures have not had time to prepare." Ads were placed in the newspapers </p>
<p class="calibre1">publishing the new deadline. That same day, July 9, a census staffer jotted a </p>
<p class="calibre1">notation that the census forms had been received, and they "will be done as </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon as the Department of the Interior has the necessary personnel."113 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A December 1, 1941, letter from a provincial administrator to the Pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fect of Police explained that only Jews who had a residence in France were </p>
<p class="calibre1">required to register. That left out the many dislocated Jews residing in hotels </p>
<p class="calibre1">or living with another family, including many refugees. One survey of French </p>
<p class="calibre1">provinces returning census reports itemized a long list of data missing from </p>
<p class="calibre1">their forms: many left out gender, profession, nationality, and in many cases, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all three. Many lists bore numerous typos and overtyped sections, so some </p>
<p class="calibre1">names and addresses were illegible.114 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Interior Ministry dispatched its long list of instructions to all </p>
<p class="calibre1">prefects in France, it included a caution: "Since the number of these cards is </p>
<p class="calibre1">limited due to their high price, please let me know, after creating the cards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the categories in which you have extra cards. This way I can distribute them </p>
<p class="calibre1">to other Prefectures who have a shortage, as they will also be letting me </p>
<p class="calibre1">know which cards they are short on."115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As France began its census activities, none of it was being recorded </p>
<p class="calibre1">on punch card for automated retrieval. The operating budget reports for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the GCJQ listed every expenditure for rentals, ribbons, and repairs on </p>
<p class="calibre1">seven  Remington  and  Underwood  typewriters,  but  not  a  f r anc  on  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">services.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  as  French  prefects  and  the  GCJQ  struggled  to  keep  up  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">waves  of  registrations,  the  Germans  besieged  their  offices  with  unending </p>
<p class="calibre1">requests  for  specific  data  that  stretched  their  manual  capabilities  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">maximum.  The  experience  of  a  single  prefect  was  typical.  On  January  29, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942,  a  German  official  asked  the  Prefect  of  Eure  for  the  personal  declara- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  made  by  district  Jews,  as  well  as  inventories  of  their  Jewish  goods  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprises.  That  same  day,  he  also  requested  information  from  the  provi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sional  administrators  of  Jewish  housing.  On  March  14  and  again  on  April  2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Prefect  of  Eure  furnished  the  Police  for  Jewish  Concerns  with  selected </p>
<p class="calibre1">demographic  information.  On  June  5,  1942,  the  Eure  Prefect  sent  the  Police </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Jewish  Concerns  various  tables  listing  Jews  by  age,  gender,  nationality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  profession—all  in  duplicate.  On  July  3,  1942,  the  Police  for  Jewish  Con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cerns  needed  the  number  of  Jews  between  ages  16  and  45  wearing  the  yel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">low  star,  all  Jews  between  16  and  45  required  to  wear  the  yellow  star  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">though  married  to  an  Aryan,  Jews  older  than  45  wearing  the  yellow  star,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  Jews  who  because  of  their  nationality  did  not  wear  the  yellow  star  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">all.  All  names  were  to  be  typed  by  gender  listing  all  names  and  addresses </p>
<p class="calibre1">where available.117 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  move  to  centralize  all  the  information  into  a  single,  easily  accessible </p>
<p class="calibre1">catalog,  100,000  forms  were  sent  to  a  special  police  unit  headquartered  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hotel  de  Russie  in  Vichy.  In  December  1941,  the  Police  for  Jewish  Con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cerns  could  finally  visualize  the  massive  quantity  of  census  and  registration </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  to  be  sorted.  The  police  bureau  told  CGJQ  director  Xavier  Vallat  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  task  was  impossible.  On  December  19,  1941,  Vallat  acknowledged  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">crisis.  "The  file  would  normally  be  established  by  your  police  service," </p>
<p class="calibre1">asserted  Vallat,  "but  it  has  become  apparent  from  several  conversations  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">your  offices  that  it  has  neither  the  personnel  required  nor  the  equipment </p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary  for  this  operation.  Due  to  this  situation  we  have  thought  to  ask </p>
<p class="calibre1">[for] help."118 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vallat  unexpectedly  found  the  help  he  needed.  Rene  Carmille,  comp- </p>
<p class="calibre1">troller  general  of  the  French  Army,  had  for  years  been  an  ardent  advocate  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards.  More  than  that,  he  had  machines  in  good  working  order  at  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">government's  Demographic  Service.  Carmille  came  forward  and  offered  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">end  the  census  chaos.  He  promised  that  his  tabulators  could  deliver  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">of France.119 </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN  GERMAN  requisition  teams  began  pilfering  Hollerith  machines  in  Au- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gust  1940,  Rene  Carmille,  a  mysterious  French  military  technocrat,  rescued </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  tabulators.  Under  cover  of  night,  he  moved  the  precious  devices  from  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  finance  office  to  a  hiding  place  in  a  garage.  In  so  doing,  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">military's  punch  card  capability  was  preserved.  A  few  months  later,  on  Novem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  14,  1940,  Carmille  single-handedly  created  France's  Demographic  Service </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Vichy.  It  was  just  a  few  weeks  after  the  first  Jewish  census  in  the  Occupied </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zone,  and  from  the  Nazi  viewpoint,  the  new  agency  was  wholly  compatible </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Berlin's  labor  recruitment  and  racial  agenda.  The  Vichy  government  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trusted  his  agency  with  the  responsibility  for  all  social  statistics  projects.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">operated at least twenty offices on both sides of the zone boundary.120 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  established,  Carmille  carefully  began  strengthening  his  small </p>
<p class="calibre1">arsenal  of  tabulators.  Not  only  did  he  work  with  Holleriths,  but  he  also  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">access  to  a  Bull  and  even  a  Powers  machine.  In  1941,  Carmille  signed  a  36- </p>
<p class="calibre1">million-francs  contract  with  Bull  for  new  machines,  even  though  the  chance </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  delivery  from  their  new  plant  in  Lyon  was  in  great  doubt.  He  also  signed </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  multi-million-franc  contract  with  CEC  calling  for  a  series  of  powerful </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  to  be  delivered  on  a  strict  schedule;  millions  of  francs  in  fines  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">penalties were to be paid by CEC if they could not maintain the delivery reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">imen.121 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Carmille  began  the  Demographic  Service,  he  was  not  allied  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the General Commission on Jewish Questions, the anti-Semitic Vichy agency </p>
<p class="calibre1">coordinating  Jewish  registrations.  But  he  was  certainly  hoping  to  attract  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency's  attention.  In  March  1941,  he  made  a  point  of  informing  GCJQ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Director Vallat that his statistics for Jewish students were incorrect.122 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  had  been  working  for  months  on  a  national  Personal  Identifi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cation  Number,  a  number  that  would  not  only  be  sequential,  but  descriptive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thirteen-digit PIN number would be a manual "bar code" of sorts </p>
<p class="calibre1">describing  an  individual's  complete  personal  profile  as  well  as  professional </p>
<p class="calibre1">skills  in  great  detail.  For  example,  one  number  would  be  assigned  for  metal </p>
<p class="calibre1">workers,  with  a  second  modifying  number  for  brass,  and  then  a  third  modi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fying  number  for  curtain  rods.  Tabulators  could  then  be  set  to  whisk </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  millions  of  cards  until  it  located  French  metal  workers,  specializing </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  brass  with  experience  in  curtain  rods.  Those  metal  workers  could  also  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">pinpointed  in  any  district.  The  system  mimicked  a  concurrent  Reich  codifica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  system  that  assigned  a  descriptive  bar  code-like  number  to  every  prod- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uct  and  component  in  Germany.  Carmille's  number  would  ultimately  evolve </p>
<p class="calibre1">into France's social security number.123 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In spring 1941, Carmille was readying the professional July 1941 cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  of  all  French  citizens  aged  14  to  65.  Question  11  asked  Jews  to  identify </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  not  only  by  their  professed  religion  but  also  by  their  grand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">parents. The program was highly publicized. An article in the New York Times </p>
<p class="calibre1">several  weeks  later  reported,  "Special  registering  machines  are  being  used  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  census.  By  a  system  of  perforations—every  citizen  will  receive  a  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">composed  of  thirteen  digits—information  will  be  obtainable  .  .  .  county  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">county."  An  interesting  emphasis  in  the  questionnaire  was  on  agricultural </p>
<p class="calibre1">skills.  A  second  New  York  Times  article  on  the  census  actually  identified  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">program  as  tied  to  an  agricultural  drive.124  Any  Vichy  official  or  Nazi  repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sentative  in  France  would  surely  approve  of  such  a  census.  It  would  not  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">identify the workers, including farm laborers, but the Jews among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  mid-June  1941,  Vichy  launched  the  second  major  census  of  Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  one  in  both  zones.  The  question  was  how  would  the  questionnaires  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">processed,  through  manual  methods  with  paper  files,  or  with  the  dynamic </p>
<p class="calibre1">capabilities of Holleriths? </p>
<p class="calibre1">LYON, JUNE 18, 1941 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Xavier Vallat </p>
<p class="calibre1">General Commissioner for Jewish Questions </p>
<p class="calibre1">Object: Census of the Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  June  2,  1941  law,  published  in  the  Journal  Officiel  on  June  14, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941,  orders  a  census  of  all  persons  who  are  considered  Jewish  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes of the law of that same date regarding the status of Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  inquiry  that..  .  your  General  Commissariat  is  going  to  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  greatly  interests  the  Demographics  Department,  which  was  given </p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility  for  all  statistical  operations  regarding  the  population  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">France.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  Service  just  organized,  in  the  unoccupied  zone,  the  first  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  professional  activities  of  all  persons  14  to  65  years  old.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  gathered,  as  well  as  all  information  coming  from  further </p>
<p class="calibre1">inquiries  conducted  in  both  the  occupied  and  unoccupied  zones,  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  used  to  create  and  maintain  an  updated  file  on  each  individual  sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ming  up  their  activities.  This  will  be  used  to  produce,  at  any  given </p>
<p class="calibre1">moment, the general demographic profile of the nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seems  to  me  that  in  these  conditions,  the  special  [June  14]  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Jews  could  possibly  bring  complementary  information  that  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  more  interesting  given  that  the  inquiries  cover  not  only  people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but their belongings as well. These considerations lead me to ask you </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  please  tell  me  right  now  how  your  inquiry  will  be  conducted,  details </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  questions  asked,  and  later  on,  the  results  you  will  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  case  the  model  of  Jewish  census  forms  is  not  definitively  estab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lished,  I  am  at  your  service  to  study  . . .   a  form  that  should  permit  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Commissariat,  as  well  as  the  Demographics  Department,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">unify  all  useful  information  about  the  Jews.  This  will  allow  us  to  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cover  those  [Jews]  who  have  not  yet  made  their  declaration,  so  we  can </p>
<p class="calibre1">organize  an  inquiry  as  to  the  status  of  their  belongings  and  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">potential transfer ... and definitively clarify the Jewish problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  am  sending  an  Administrator  of  the  Demographics  Department  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">explain  to  you  the  organization  of  the  Service,  its  work  methods,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  results  obtained  by  using  tabulation  processes  to  manage  individual </p>
<p class="calibre1">files.  He  will  also  examine  with  you  the  conditions  in  which  collabora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion between the Services concerned would be advantageous to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rene Carmille125 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  many  French  bureaucrats,  Vallat  was  resistant  to  Carmille's  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">traptions.  He  worried  that  commencing  a  punching  operation  from  scratch </p>
<p class="calibre1">would delay the reports. Vallat trusted the Tulard system, even though it was </p>
<p class="calibre1">ma n u a l —and  probably  because  it  was  manual.  So  on  June  21,  Vallat  wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">back to Carmille, "I have thought about integrating this census with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations  your  department  handles,  but  it  did  not  seem  possible  to  me,  first </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  prolong  the  process,  given  the  economic  urgency  of  the  census  of  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">persons  and  belongings,  and  second,  given  the  particular  nature  of  the  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation  that  I  need.  And  I  decided  to  immediately  order  a  [Tulard]  file  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">has proved valuable in the occupied zone and which I will distribute to pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fects and mayors in the coming week. I will always be happy to provide you </p>
<p class="calibre1">with any information thus obtained."126 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  when  Vallat's  people  were  confronted  with  the  mountains  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  to  be  assimilated  did  they  realize  that  Carmille  presented  the  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">hope  of  efficiendy  identifying  the  Jews.  Vallat  transferred  the  processing </p>
<p class="calibre1">assignment  to  him.  On  October  11,  1941,  Carmille  formed  the  National  Sta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tistical  Service,  which  subsumed  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  France  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">merged  it  with the  Demographic  Service.  Carmille stated, "The  new  statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">service  would  have  a  different  point  of  departure,  namely  to  establish  files </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  individuals."  He  added,  "We  are  no  longer  dealing  with  general  censuses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  we  are  really  following  individuals."  Carmille  made  clear,  "the  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">organization must now be envisioned in such a way that the information be </p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained  continuously,  which  means  that  the  updating  of  information  must </p>
<p class="calibre1">be carefully regulated."127 Carmille was now France's great Hollerith hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  December  2,  1941,  Vallat  notified  Carmille,  "The  Jewish  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations  in  the  occupied  zone,  as  ordered  by  the  law  of  2  June  1941,  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">finished;  we  collected  approximately  140,000  declarations."128  On  December </p>
<p class="calibre1">19,  a  seemingly  impatient  Vallat  complained  to  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  file  would  normally  be  established  by  your  Police  service.  But  it  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  apparent  from  several  conversations  with  your  offices  that  it  has  nei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther  the  personnel  required  nor  the  equipment  necessary  for  this  operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Due  to  this  situation  we  have  thought  to  ask  the  help  of  the  designated </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demographic  Service  to  ensure the  completion  of  this  task  for  which they  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">equitably  suited.  They  have  agreed  and  they  have  offered  to  forward  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">task to their tabulating workshops in Clermont-Ferrand and Limoges."129 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vallat  later  asked  the  Ministry  to  pay  the  considerable  cost  of  the  tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lation  services,  400,000  francs,  and  to  arrange  for  transportation  of  materials </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Carmille  offices.  That  was  approved.130  Now  the  Jewish  forms  were  all  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the possession of Carmille. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  numbers  were  just  not  matching  up.  Vallat  was  to  have  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">140,000  personal  declarations.  But  on  June  3,  1942,  Carmille's  office  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">firmed  it  had  "received  to  date  109,066  declarations,  of  which  20%  (exactly </p>
<p class="calibre1">17,980  declarations)  were  not  received  until  4  May  1942."131  Things  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">going much slower than anyone expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  further  delay  the  operation,  CEC  was  now  defaulting  on  its  rigid </p>
<p class="calibre1">delivery  schedule.  CEC  just  could  not  manufacture  machines  as  required </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  Dehomag  was  usurping  all  its  resources.  In  early  1943,  the  subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Paris  informed  IBM  NY,  "A  certain  number  of  transactions  with  the  Na- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional Statistical Service have . . . caused the application of penalties. . . . The </p>
<p class="calibre1">amount of these penalties might reach a figure of 4 million [francs] in view of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  size  and  importance  of  the  deals,  and  because  of  the  company's  inability </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  deliver  machines  according  to  contract  schedules....  A  one  year  delay  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">waving of penalties was requested."132 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  meantime,  Berlin  would  not  wait.  Using  the  less  efficient  Tulard </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,  it  began  organizing  round-ups  of  Jews  in  Paris.  In  early  May  1941, </p>
<p class="calibre1">6,494  summonses  were  left  at  presumed  Jewish  residences,  mainly  foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews.  They  were  instructed  to  report  on  May  14  to  one  of  seven  centers </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  their  identification  in  hand.  Nazi-allied  officials  could  not  be  certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">exacdy  which  addresses  were  accurate  and  up-to-date.  With  Carmille's  tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lations  not  yet  ready,  the  Germans,  in  essence,  relied  on  the  Jews  to  turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves in. The results yielded only half what the Nazis had hoped for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the appointed day, May 14, 1941, an estimated 3,400 to 3,700 Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mainly of Polish origin, did report as requested. They were immediately sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">to camps.133 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  second  raid  was  conducted  on  August  20,  1941.  This  time,  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">agitators, including many professionals, in Paris' 11th Arrondissement were </p>
<p class="calibre1">targeted. The Tulard files offered precise lists of names and addresses and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even stairwells of many Jews. But the numbers again fell short. Police units </p>
<p class="calibre1">cordoned  off  major  intersections—and  even  blocked  the  subway  exits,  grab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bing  any  Jewish  man  between  the  ages  of  18  and  50.  But  only  3,022  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  arrested.  For  three  more  days,  the  authorities  tried  to  locate  more  Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  inefficient  operation  only  netted  609  on  August  21.  Then  on  August  22, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  located  325  more.  On  August  23,  as  the  word  spread  and  Jews  every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  in  the  District  tried  to  disappear,  only  122  Jews  were  nabbed.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">total for the four days was 4,078. The men were sent to the Drancy transit </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration  camp.  Paris  was  shocked  and  outraged  because  the  raids  seized </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  foreign  and  French-born  Jews.134  But  for  the  Germans,  it  meant  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">updated data from Tulard was profoundly inefficient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  third  major  raid  on  December  12,    1941,  hoped  to  snare  1,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parisian  professionals.  The  obsolete  Tulard  files  only  yielded  743  correct </p>
<p class="calibre1">addresses.  To  round  out  the  numbers,  foreign  Jews  were  picked  up  at  ran- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dom </p>
<p class="calibre1">on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris </p>
<p class="calibre1">streets.135 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where was Carmille? Where were his Holleriths? </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  end  of  1941,  numerous  Vichy  officials  had  concluded  the  elabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  census  of  June  1941  conducted  in  both  zones  was  completely  nonfunc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional. A new one was needed.136 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On January 13, 1942, the Vichy Finance Minister, conscious of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary expense, bitterly objected to the Interior Ministry. "A general </p>
<p class="calibre1">census of the Jews has already been done," the Finance Minister complained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  all  the  desired  information  had  been  requested  at  the  time,  it  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">superfluous to undertake a new census a few months later. I ask you please </p>
<p class="calibre1">do  not  proceed  with  the  projected  census  or  with  other  measures  of  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">nature  without  consulting  the  National  Statistics  Service.  Their  experience  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  matter  could  be  helpful  in  avoiding  gaps  or  repeated  information  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  present  serious  problems  from  a  technical  as  well  as  a  financial  point </p>
<p class="calibre1">of view."137 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, where was Carmille? </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  February  1942,  Eichmann's  office  in  Paris  reported  that  the  prefec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ture  lists  were  completely  insufficient,  asserting,  "our  offices  are  constantly </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanding corrections."138 Something needed to be done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">German officials began turning to the French Jewish Council for names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Union Generale des Israelites en France, the so-called UGIF, became a </p>
<p class="calibre1">prime      source  for  the  Gestapo.  The  UGIF  was  vested  with  the  sole  authority </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  all  Jewish  welfare  and  any  other  communication  between  the  Jews  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occupied  France  and  the  German  authorities.  Therefore,  Jews  invariably </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  to  the  UGIF  offices to  sign  up  for  welfare  services and  submit inquiries </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  interned  loved  ones.  French  Jews  even  paid  special  communal  assess- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  to  the  UGIF.  The  Germans  granted  the  UGIF  unprecedented  access </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  all  Vichy  census  lists  and  allowed  the  organization  to  manually  update </p>
<p class="calibre1">them.  These  were  then  turned  over  to  the  Nazis  by  the  UGIF.  In  fact,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">UGIF  maintained  a  whole  department  for  providing  lists  to  the  authorities </p>
<p class="calibre1">They called it Service 14.139 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  one  list  was  not  up-to-date,  the  Germans  asked  for  a  revision— </p>
<p class="calibre1">again  and  again  until  perhaps  on  the  fourth  revision  the  names  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">complete.140 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  many  cases,  Nazi  agents  merely  waited  to  abduct  those  Jews  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">ventured to the constandy watched UGIF office.141 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  many  Parisian  Jews  feared  appealing  to  the  UGIF  for  assis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance,  at  some  point  of  economic,  emotional,  or  familial  desperation,  a  num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  would  risk  the  approach.  Ail  too  often,  that  contact  would  presage  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">apprehension.  The  UGIF's  efforts  to  comply  with  German  demands  for  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinually updated names could only be described as relendess.142 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  in  July  1942,  the  UGIF  Bulletin  published  a  notice  regard- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  children  of  incarcerated  parents.  These  children,  living  in  terror,  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">essentially  being  hidden  by  family  friends  and  relatives.  "We  are  composing  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">central  listing,"  read  the  UGIF  notice,  "of  all  those  Jewish  children  whose </p>
<p class="calibre1">parents  were  arrested  recently.  If  the  children  were  taken  in  by  a  private </p>
<p class="calibre1">organization  or  by  individual  families,  and  you  have  knowledge  of  this,  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">request  you  let  us  know  immediately."  The  notice  was  published  within  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">framework  of  UGIF  welfare  services  that  sought  to  render  financial  assis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance to abandoned or orphaned Jewish children.143 </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  in  a  telling  rebuttal  some  weeks  later,  another  quasi-sanctioned </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  organization  aligned  with  the  resistance  declared:  if  welfare  assistance </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  displaced  children  involved  produced  a  list  of  the  families  who  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken them in, the UGIF should not bother.144 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  when  the  UGIF  tried  to  impose  a  special  head  tax  to  finance </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  new  UGIF  census,  the  underground  press  condemned  it  in  no  uncer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOTICE FROM THE JEWISH UNDERGROUND </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  participate  in  the  expenses  of  the  Union  Generale  des  Israelites </p>
<p class="calibre1">en  France,  and  to  compensate  for  the  insufficient  voluntary  contributions,  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  .  .  .  will  be  subject  to  a  head-tax  of  120  francs  for  the  occupied  zone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  360  francs  for  the  non-occupied  zone.  .  .  .  The  tattletaling  .  .  .  enterprise </p>
<p class="calibre1">created by the Gestapo needs money and, filled with audacity, imposes a con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tribution  upon  its  victims,  "whose  voluntary  contributions"  are  insufficient— </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  with  good  reason.  .  ,  .  Everyone  knows  how  the  UGIF  helps  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfortunates.  Like  in  Paris,  where  she  turns  over  to  the  Gestapo  the  children </p>
<p class="calibre1">entrusted  to  her  care;  like  in  Marseilles  where  the  Jews  who  go  to  collect </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  dole  are  immediately  attacked  by  the  Gestapo,  forewarned  by  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">organization  of  traitors.  .  .  .  Solidarity  is  practiced  by  the  Jews  .  .  .  [but  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">by]  the  traitors  who  want  one  more  chance  to  earn  the  salary  their  masters  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vichy  and  Berlin  allocate  for  them,  by  organizing  a  new  census  of  the  Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For this is also the meaning of the new contribution.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boycott this new census! Do not give a penny to the UGIF! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not a penny to the Germans!145 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  July  1942,  Eichmann  arrived  in  Paris  with  direct  orders  from  Himmler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  Jews  of  France—foreign  or  native-born—were  to  be  immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent to camps. Eichmann began personally supervising the systematic depor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tation  of  Jews.  Berlin  had  assigned  37,000  freight  cars,  800  passenger  cars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  1,000  locomotives  to  Occupied  France.  But  local  authorities  were  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly falling short on the quotas.146 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  15,  one  train  could  not  leave  on  time.  Eichmann  was  outraged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling  the  missed  departure  "disgraceful"  in  view  of  how  much  effort  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">gone  into  the  schedule.  A  Nazi  official  assigned  to  the  Jewish  solution </p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled  the  moment:  Eichmann  threatened,  the  Nazi  recalled,  that  perhaps </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  might  "drop  France  entirely  as  a  country  to  be  evacuated."  The  belea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">guered  Nazi  promised  Eichmann  no  more  trains  would  be  late.  Frantic  local </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  did  everything  they  could  to  comply  with  Eichmann's  obsessive </p>
<p class="calibre1">demand  for  Jews.  Hence  all  attempts  to  create  a  hierarchy  of  exemptions </p>
<p class="calibre1">within  the  French  ultra-conservative  mindset,  such  as  for  women  or  chil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dren, or French nationals or war veterans—these all quickly eroded.147 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Typical  was  the  frenzy  exhibited  by  one  French  policeman  when  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">scribbled a note on September 12, 1942: "Under our current obligation to </p>
<p class="calibre1">come up with one thousand deportees on Monday, we must include in these </p>
<p class="calibre1">departures...  the  parents  of  sick  [children]  and  advise  them  that  they  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">be deported with their child remaining in the infirmary."148 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  1942,  the  Germans  must  have  wondered  what  had  hap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pened  to  Carmille's  operation.  GCJQ  Commissioner  Vallat  had  assured  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry  of  the  Interior  that  Carmille  would  provide  "day-to-day  mainte- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nance  of  the  file  using  perfected  tabulation  processes.  .  .  .  our  Services  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  permanent  access  to  an  updated  database  for  its  work."  To  this  end, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  had  been  given  a  card  file  of  120,000.  He  had  the  only  copy.  There </p>
<p class="calibre1">was no duplicate.149 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Carmille continued a mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  October  1943,  Rene  Carmille  traveled  under  an  assumed  name  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the town of Annemasse, near the Swiss border, for a secret meeting with rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tives  of  Emile  Genon,  director  of  IBM  Belgium.  Genon  was  now  stationed  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  and  had  been  assigned  by  IBM  NY  to  maintain  up-to-date  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  on  all  European  subsidiaries  being  operated  by  German-appointed  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">todians.  Genon  wanted  intelligence  about  Westerholt,  the  SS  man  appointed </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  trustee.  What  were  his  strengths  and  weaknesses?  Carmille  gladly  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vided  it,  as  he  needed  the  continued  help  of  IBM  for  his  punch  card  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  Indeed,  just  after  the  War,  Watson  would  dispatch  a  personal  emissary </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  long-time  aide,  J.  J.  Kenney,  to  meet  with  Carmille's  widow  in  Paris  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hotel  Georges  V.  At  that  post-war  meeting,  Kenney  extended  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">personal thanks for Carmille's regular information.150 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  Carmille  was  running  an  active  tabulator  operation.  Why  wasn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">he producing the Jewish lists? </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  November  8,  1942,  the  Americans,  along  with  some  British  troops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  landed  in  Algeria.  As  many  hoped,  local  French  forces  joined  the  Allied </p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign  against  Hitler.  On  December  5,  1942,  French  forces  seized  the  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">National  Statistics  Service  branch  office  in  Algiers.  Using  Carmille's  system  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulators  and  punch  card  files,  DeGaulle's  people  were  able  to  organize  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">seemingly  miraculous  rapid  mobilization  of  thousands  of  Frenchmen  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">others  into  specific  units.  As  soon  as  January  17,  1943,  the  loyal  French  ele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments in Algeria were ready to fight as a cohesive and efficient army.151 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instandy  mobilized  French  forces  in  Algeria  fiercely  fought  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">army  along  the  Algerian-Tunisian  border  until  the  Reich  was  dislodged.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  beginning  of  the  end  of  Hitler's  army  in  North  Africa.  Those  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">units proceeded to Italy and continued to fight throughout the war.152 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Germans  could  not  understand  how  the  French  army  in  Algeria </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  assembled  so  quickly.  Carmille's  office  there  had  only  been  tracking </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, farm workers, and general laborers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  days  after  the  French  mobilized  in  Algeria  the  Nazis  discovered </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Carmille  was  a  secret  agent  for  the  French  resistance.  He  had  no  inten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of delivering the Jews. It was all a cover for French mobilization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SECTION III F </p>
<p class="calibre1">German Intelligence </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Section  received  from  Paris  a  dossier  in  which  there  was  found  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  about  a  special bureau  in  Lyon  which,  under  the cover  of a  census  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">population,  was  in  fact  a  secret  mobilization  office.  We  had  been  informed </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  nearly  all  the  directors  of  that  office  were  General  Officers  or  Superior </p>
<p class="calibre1">Officers  [of  the  resistance].  The  Demographic  Office  could  find,  in  a  matter </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  moments,  using  special  cards,  all  the  specialists  (Aviators,  Tank  Drivers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mechanics,  etc.  .  .  .  [both  the]  officers  and  enlisted  personnel)  needed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  up  organized  units.  .  .  .  This  was  not  a  census  bureau  but  rather  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">office of mobilization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter Wilde </p>
<p class="calibre1">special agent153 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  had  deceived  the  Nazis.  In  fact,  he  had  been  working  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  counter-intelligence  since  1911.  During  the  worst  days  of  Vichy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  was  always  considered  one  of  the  highest-placed  operatives  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  resistance,  a  member  of  the  so-called  "Marco  Polo  Network"  of  sabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teurs  and  spies.  Carmille's  operation  had  generated  some  20,000  fake  iden- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tity  passes.  And  he  had  been  laboring  for  months  on  a  database  of  800,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">former   soldiers  in  France  who  could  be  instandy  mobilized  into  well- </p>
<p class="calibre1">planned  units  to  fight  for  liberation.  Under  his  plan,  300,000  men  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  to  go.  He  had  their  names,  addresses,  their  military  specialties,  and  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  occupational  skills.  He  knew  which  ones  were  metal  workers  specializ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing in curtain rods, and which were combat-ready troops.154 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for column 11 asking for Jewish identity, the holes were never </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched—the answers were never tabulated.155 More than 100,000 cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jews sitting in his office—never handed over.156 He foiled the entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two punch cards were secretly obtained and sent to Gestapo headquar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters at Hotel Lutetia in Paris. Carmille was exposed. Some German officers </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded his immediate arrest along with the fourteen-member senior staff </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the National Statistics Services. But German intelligence officer Wilde rea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">soned that someone needed to run the tabulators so that crucial work </p>
<p class="calibre1">brigades  could  still  be  marshaled  to  Germany.  After  all,  the  strictly  occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pational  information  was  indeed  up  to  date.  So  Carmille  was  allowed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">continue  his  operation.  But  automated  Jewish  information  was  now  beyond </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi reach.157 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suspecting  he  was  under  suspicion,  Carmille  nonetheless  fearlessly </p>
<p class="calibre1">addressed  the  1943  graduating  class  of  the  Polytechnic  School  in  Paris  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">his remarks could easily be overheard: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No  power  in  the  world"  he  exhorted  them,  "can  stop  you  from  remembering </p>
<p class="calibre1">that you are the heirs of those who defended the country of France, from those </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  stood  on  the  bridge  of  Bouvines...  to  those  who  fought  at  the  Marne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember  that!  "No  power  in  the  world  can  stop  you  from  remembering  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  are  the  heirs  of  Cartesian  thought,  of  the  mysticism  and  mathematics  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pascal,  of  the  clarity  of  the  writers  of  the  16th  Century,  and  the  perennial </p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishments  of  the  19th  Century  thinkers,  all  this—in  France.  Remember </p>
<p class="calibre1">that!  "No  power in the  world  can  stop  you  from  realizing  that  your  institution </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  furnished  the  world  with  [great]  thinkers  .  .  .  that  freedom  of  thought  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">always existed... with rigor and tenacity. Remember that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No power in the world can stop you from knowing that the motto inscribed in </p>
<p class="calibre1">gold  letters  on  the  pavilion:  For  Country,  For  Knowledge,  and  For  Glory'  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the weighty heritage that constitutes the immense work of your ancestors, is for </p>
<p class="calibre1">you a categorical imperative which must guide your path of conduct. Remember </p>
<p class="calibre1">that! "All this is written in your soul, and no one can control your soul, because </p>
<p class="calibre1">your soul only belongs to God."158 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  early  1944,  SS  security  officers  ordered  Carmille  arrested.  He  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">apprehended  in  Lyon  at  noon  on  February  3,  1944.  He  was  taken  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hotel  Terminus  where  his  interrogator  was  the  infamous  Butcher  of  Lyon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klaus  Barbie.  Barbie  was despised as  a  master  of torture  who  had  sadistically </p>
<p class="calibre1">questioned  many  members  of  the  resistance.  Carmille  went  for  two  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">straight under Barbie's hand. He never cracked.159 </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON  JUNE  11,  1942,  Germany  had  ordered  15,000  Jews  immediately  deported </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Holland.  Eichmann's  people  used  the  word  "evacuated."  The  ultimate </p>
<p class="calibre1">destination  for  Dutch  Jewry  would  be  the  death  camps  of  Auschwitz  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sobibor.160 </p>
<p class="calibre1">France's  quota  was  100,000  drawn  from  both  Zones.  But  Theodor  Dan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">necker,  Eichmann's  assistant  in  Paris,  realized  he  could  never  meet  his  quota. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On June 22, 1942, the numbers suddenly changed.161 </p>
<p class="calibre1">France's  new  quota      was    reduced    to    40,000  Jews.      H o l l a n d ' s     was    in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">creased to 40,000.162 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland's Hollerith program under Lentz was a model of efficiency. By </p>
<p class="calibre1">Match of 1944, Waffen-SS commanders in The Hague had ordered a new </p>
<p class="calibre1">bombproof facility for Lentz' Population Registry. The new center was to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">laced with bunkers to protect the Holleriths and their precious cards. Sepa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate punching, tabulating, and alphabetizing rooms were arranged around a </p>
<p class="calibre1">massive punching pool. One corner office was designated just for "lost </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards." Administrative and control offices completed the complex.163 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  Dutch  Jewry  handily  identified,  residentially  confined  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">ghetto-like  conditions,  and  constantly  tracked,  all  that  remained  now  was  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">organize  their  efficient  deportation  to  concentration  camps.  Their  names </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  called  up  in  an  orderly  fashion  by  demographic  sector,  age,  or  geo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">graphic locale, and of course always alphabetized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It began in July 1941. Names were taken from the Central Office card </p>
<p class="calibre1">indices. Special demographic maps at the Amsterdam Municipal Bureau of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistics  identified  the  Jewish  population,  district  by  district,  using  red  num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bers  for  Jews  and  blue  numbers  for  non-Jews.  In  some  maps,  "dots"  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">marked  onto  city  maps  to  more  graphically  identify  Jewish  population  den- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sity by district—the more dots in a district, the more Jews. By July 1942, reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ular transports started running to a Dutch transit camp called Westerbork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Dutch Judenrat, known as the Joodsche Raad, sent a contingent from its </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  staff  to  Westerbork  to  function  as  a  registration  department.  Arrivals  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Westerbork were directed into a large registration hall manned by about </p>
<p class="calibre1">sixty registrars, who would take the prisoners' identity papers, ration cards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and other personal documents.164 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One British intelligence report at the time declared, "The human being </p>
<p class="calibre1">[now] becomes a number. ... A duplicate of the new barracks number card </p>
<p class="calibre1">goes into the card index.... a special card index [is maintained] in the camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The identity papers of the deported Jews are then sent to the headquarters </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Population Register at the Hague which thus received the names of </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost all the Jews who were deported from Westerbork to Poland." From </p>
<p class="calibre1">Westerbork,  they  were  transported  to  Auschwitz  and  other  death  camps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twice weekly trains began July 15, 1942.165 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, the call up of names in Holland was so efficient, the Nazis regu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">larly exceeded their quotas. For example, during one period, orders origi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nally called for 3,000 Jews to be transported between January 11  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">January 31, 1943. But 600 additional Dutch Jews were gathered, so a total of </p>
<p class="calibre1">3,600 occupied the five transports. The next four transports carried 4,300.166 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  close  of  1942,  virtually  the  entire  40,000  initial  quota  was  met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deportations  continued.  The  8,000  Jews  residing  in  insane  asylums  and  sana- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tariums  were  targeted  next.  The  largest  was  the  facility  near  Apeldoorn,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">institution  where  inmates  had  such  difficulty  responding  coherently  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">detailed  census  questions.  January  21  and  22,  1943,  SS  detachments  arrived </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Apeldoorn  hospital.  In  what  was  recorded  as  a  particularly  brutal  episode, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  SS  men  sadistically  beat  and  herded  the  bewildered  inmates,  including </p>
<p class="calibre1">many children, into catde wagons—and from there to the train depot.167 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  never  stopped  in  Holland.  The  Population  Registry  continued  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">spew out tabulations of names. The trains continued to roll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  in  France,  the  Germans  also  deported  Jews  to  death  camps </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  often  as  possible.  But  in  France,  Nazi  forces  were  compelled  to  continue </p>
<p class="calibre1">their random and haphazard round-ups.168 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  was  sent  to  Dachau,  prisoner  76608,  where  he  died  of  exhaus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  on  January  25,  1945.  He  was  posthumously  honored  as  a  patriot </p>
<p class="calibre1">although  his  role  in  dramatically  reducing  the  number  of  Jewish  deaths  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  was  never  really  known  and  in  some  cases  doubted.  How  many  lives </p>
<p class="calibre1">he saved will never be tabulated. After the war, Lentz explained he was just a </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  servant.  He  was  tried,  but  only  on  unrelated  charges,  for  which  he  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">sentenced to three years inprison.169 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland  had  Lentz.  France  had  Carmille.  Holland  had  a  well-entrenched </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  infrastructure.  France's  punch  card  infrastructure  was  in  complete </p>
<p class="calibre1">disarray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final numbers: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  an      estimated      140,000      Dutch    Jews,      more      than      107,000    were </p>
<p class="calibre1">deported,  and  of  those  102,000  were  murdered—a  death  ratio  of  approxi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately 73 percent.170 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  an  estimated  300,000  to  350,000  Jews  living  in  France,  both  zones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  85,000  were  deported—of  these  barely  3,000  survived.  The  death </p>
<p class="calibre1">ratio in France was approximately 25 percent.171 </p>

<p class="calibre1">of  admiring  executives,  a  fascinated  American  public,  and  enamored </p>

<p class="calibre1">Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull.  Chiefs  of  state  and  royal  families  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">several  continents  welcomed  his  company.  His  veneration  interna- </p>

<p class="calibre1">IBM's  marginal  or  improper  actions  against  American  interests,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">reluctance  was  quiet  and  cautious.  These  were  exceptions  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rule  of  deference  and  cooperation  always  afforded  America's  almost </p>
<p class="calibre1">regal industrialist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the stream of IBM's Treasury license requests to trans- </p>

<p class="calibre1">or IBM's corporate prestige. Rather, he was just a simple person </p>

<p class="calibre1">frequently  referred  to  as  the  "Economic  Warfare  Section"  attached  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  of  Justice.  Its  mission  was  to  acquire  economic  intelligence  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">confound  enemy  commerce.  Carter  was  also  looking  into  a  category  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">crimes  loosely  styled  "trading  with  the  enemy."  He  understood  that  foiling </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  commercial  and  technologic  infrastructure  of  the  Axis  powers  was  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  as  deploying  tanks  and  troops.  Carter's  combat  was  waged  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  carbines  and  grenades,  but  with  subpoenas  and  indictments.  During </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942  and  early  1943,  he  began  looking  at  International  Business  Machines. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Manhattan,  Carter  must  have  comprehended  that  he  was  but  a  very  small </p>
<p class="calibre1">person  looking  into  a  very  big  operation  run  by  very  powerful  people.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  could  pick  up  the  phone  and  call  the  White  House,  the  Secretary  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Treasury,  or the  most  senior  Army  officials.  But  Carter  was  unaffected  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  gravisphere.  He  saw  something  very  different  in  the  haze  and  maze </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  IBM's  involvement  with  Nazis.  Carter  was  determined  to  put  the  pieces </p>
<p class="calibre1">together.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  reviewing  Treasury  license  requests,  media  reports,  financial </p>
<p class="calibre1">filings,  intelligence  intercepts  from  Switzerland,  and  other  materials,  Carter </p>
<p class="calibre1">concluded  that  IBM  had  constructed  a  unique  international  cartel  responsi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ble  for  about  90  percent  of  the  punch  card  technology  in  the  world.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">included  Nazi  Germany,  which  had  developed  an  extraordinary  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">industry  used  extensively  for  all  manner  of  commerce,  aggression,  and  perse- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cution.  Carter  concluded  that  IBM's  cartel  and  its  special  leasing  practices,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  its  complete  control  of  the  punch  cards  needed  to  operate  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">systems,  meant  that  the  company  possessed  a  virtual  monopoly  on  the  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology.  But  far  more  than  that,  because  of  its  grip  on  punch  cards  and  spare </p>
<p class="calibre1">parts,  and  its  ownership  of  all  machines,  IBM  exercised  virtual  dominion </p>
<p class="calibre1">over any Hollerith's day-to-day ability to function. As a result, IBM wielded a </p>
<p class="calibre1">crucial continuing impact on Nazi Germany's ability to plan and wage war.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  saw  IBM  not  as  a  great  American  company,  but  a  global  monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Carter's  view,  Watson  was  no  capitalist  luminary  but  an  opportunist  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">classed  with  the  Nazis  themselves.  The  only  way  to  secure  the  evidence  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  to  begin  prosecution  against  IBM  and  its  executives  was  to  walk  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">their headquarters and seize the documents. He needed a subpoena.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">An eighteen page draft preliminary report was prepared, complete with </p>
<p class="calibre1">diplomatic intercepts, summaries of telephone conversations between CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">and IBM Geneva, translations of letters between IBM's Werner Lier in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva and attorney Heinrich Albert in Berlin, as well as corporate corre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">spondence outlining IBM's tenacious fight against the Dehomag revolt. Carter </p>
<p class="calibre1">was cautious in building his case. But he used plain words to portray the grav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity of his investigation and explain the unique and less-than-apparent forces at </p>
<p class="calibre1">work. He entitled his undated draft "Control in Business Machines."4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CONTROL IN BUSINESS MACHINES </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  story  of  a  peculiar  type  of  cartel.  Generally  speaking,  the  cartel </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements  which  have  been  heretofore  considered  deal  with  instances </p>
<p class="calibre1">wherein  the  cartel  control  stems  from  Germany,  or  one  of  the  other  Axis </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries,  and  into  the  United  States  for  the  purpose  of  curtailing  production </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  critical  materials  following  a  deliberate  plan  of  Nazi  economic  warfare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Previously  a  villain  like  I.G.  Farben  or  Siemens  Halske  has  reached  its  tenta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cles  into  American  Industry  and  curtailed  production  through  patents,  licens- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing agreements, and other types of control. This story deals with an American </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm which has deprived not only our own citizens by limiting supply but also </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  citizenry  of  the  world.  Americans  and  Germans  alike  have  felt  the  pinch- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  hand  of  Thomas  J.  Watson  and  International  Business  Machinery  mani- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fested  through  universal  limited  production  and  international  high  prices.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  case,  the  monopoly  control  originates  in  the  United  States  and  operates </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  the  world.  And  what  Hitler  has  done  to  us  through  his  economic </p>
<p class="calibre1">warfare,  one  of  our  own  American  corporations  has  also  done.  In  this  "arse- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nal  of  democracy,"  which  supplies  materiel  for  over  half  the  warring  world, </p>
<p class="calibre1">limited  production  spells  our  worst  enemy.  Hence  IBM  is  in  a  class  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further,  we  have  a  peculiar  clash  of  interests.  This  [World  War]  is  a  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">flict  of  warlike  nationalistic  states,  each  having  certain  interests.  Yet  we  fre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quently  find  these  interests  clashing  diametrically  with  the  opposing  interests </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  international  corporate  structures,  more  huge  and  powerful  than  nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  corporate  entities  are  manned  not  by  staffs  of  citizens  of  any  nation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  by  citizens  of  the  world  looking  solely  to  the  corporate  interest  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">pledging  loyalty  thereto.  We  see  revealed  [in]  this  clash,  this  dichotomy  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">culture  between  our  nation  and  an  international  corporation  whose  interests </p>
<p class="calibre1">do not coincide... . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Hollerith was employed by the U.S. Bureau of Census in 1880 where it </p>
<p class="calibre1">was necessary for him to spend  much time in the routine of addition and </p>
<p class="calibre1">subtraction. As a timesaving device, he invented these tabulating machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">run  by  electric  current  for  the  use  of  the  Census  Bureau.  He  sold  his  patents </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  predecessor  of  International  Business  Machines  Company,  who  set  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  legal  monopoly  based  on  these  patents.  The  patents  have  since  expired </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  so  many  additional  patents  were  taken  out  by  IBM  on  improvements  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">refinements  of  the  original  Hollerith  machines  that  the  field  has  been  entirely </p>
<p class="calibre1">weighted  down  and  the  legal  monopoly  extended.  The  monopoly  still  exists </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  the  many  patents  taken  out  by  IBM  on  many  small  technical </p>
<p class="calibre1">changes  but  all  based  upon  the  original  Hollerith  patents.  A  question  might </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  be  raised  as  to  whether  the  patents  belong  to  Dr.  Hollerith  or  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Government  in  the  first  place.  .  .  .  Since  Dr.  Hollerith  was  an  employee  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">branch  of  our  government  and  since  there  was  a  definite  connection  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  work  of  computing  and  his  invention,  the  question  might  well  be  raised </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  to  whether  the  patents  belonged  to  Dr.  Hollerith  and  were  his  to  sell  or  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the U.S. Government at the time of dieir grant.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  to  the  fact  that  these  monopolies  [IBM  and  the  ones  IBM  imposed  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers  and  Remington  Rand  in  the  U.S.]  existed,  there  can  be  little  doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  companies  deliberately  conspired  to  limit  production,  dictate  price </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  restrain  competition  as  much  as  possible.  This  fact  has  been  declared  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  United  States  Supreme  Court.  We  see  a  monopoly  inflicted  on  the  people </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  United  States.  We  shall  now  attempt  to  show  the  effect  of  tjis  monop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oly on the outside world, the international cartel arrangement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  story  of  circumstantial  evidence.  Practically  no  documentation  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">direct  evidence  can  be  produced  proving  the  existence  of  the  cartel.  Yet  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">indirect  source  after  the  other  points  to  that  ultimate  conclusion  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">indirect evidence is so frequent as to be almost undeniable.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  international  corporations  have  grown  so  large  that  very  often  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">interests and the national interests within which they are supposedly contained </p>
<p class="calibre1">do  not  coincide.  The  personnel  of  IBM,  though  nominally  citizens  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United States, is actually composed of citizens of the world. Their loyalties to </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  corporation  know  no  national  bounds.  Mr.  Thomas  J.  Watson,  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">of IBM, was one of the leading figures in the international peace movement— </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  for  altruistic  motives  alone.  IBM's  far-flung  empire  was  going  much  too </p>
<p class="calibre1">smoothly to be interrupted by war and Mr. Watson's goal is profit.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly  it  can  be  said  that  his  company  is  not  an  American  company,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  international  company....  The  company  has  not  only  worked  hardship  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  people  of the  U.S. but also people in  Germany.  When the  German  section </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the world monopoly grew too burdensome on the German people, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  Government  apparently  sought  to  interfere...  The  entire  world  citi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">zenry  is  hampered  by  an  international  monster  and  the  indirect  evidence </p>
<p class="calibre1">herein  presented  seems  to  the  writer  conclusive  enough  to  warrant  an  exten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sive  search  into  files  of  the  companies  mentioned  so  that  direct  evidence  may </p>
<p class="calibre1">be obtained.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">THROUGHOUT  1942,  a  number  of  American  companies  were  grandly </p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed  for  extensive  dealings  with  Nazi  Germany.  A  so-called  "Proclaimed </p>
<p class="calibre1">List"  of  blacklisted  companies  had  grown  from  1,800  in  the  summer  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">194l  to  5,000  European  and  Latin  American  companies  by  mid-January </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942. These prohibited firms were considered either Nazi-owned or Nazi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">connected,  whether  located  in  Nazi  Europe  or  in  neutral  countries  such  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Portugal,  Spain,  or  Switzerland.  Of  course,  all  direct  trading  with  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Italy  was  prohibited.  Some  firms  were  included  merely  because  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">were considered Axis sympathizers.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  on  January  14,  1942,  five  controlling  senior  executives  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Aniline  and  Film  Corporation,  America's  third-largest  dyestuff  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ufacturer,  were  banned  from  the  company  by  the  Treasury  Department.  All </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  American  citizens,  but  of  German  birth,  and  had  for  years  been  sus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pected  of  close  ties  to  the  German  conglomerate  I.G.  Farbenindustrie.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">suspicion  was  that  I.G.  Farben  either  secretly  owned  Aniline,  or  could  domi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nate it through the five German-Americans.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  26,  1942,  a  Congressional  Committee  castigated  Standard </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oil  of  New  Jersey  for  turning  over  synthetic  rubber  processes  to  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Navy  while  withholding  the  same  technical  information  from  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States  and  British  militaries.  Investigators  cited  company  correspondence </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  a  secret  pre-Pearl  Harbor  trade  arrangement  with  I.G.  Farbenindustrie </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  permit  a  "modus  vivendi  which  would  operate  through  the  term  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war,  whether  or  not  the  United  States  came  in."  Senator  Harry  Truman,  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">headed  up  a  special  defense  investigating  committee,  publicly  excoriated </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standard  Oil's  arrangement  as  "treason"  and  "an  outrage."  An  assistant  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney general described the pact as a "devise for the continuation of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">conspiracy through the war." In reporting the scandal, the New York Times ran </p>
<p class="calibre1">an adjacent article headlined "Standard Oil Men Silent on Charges."8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further  revelations  documented  that  Standard  Oil  tried  to  do  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Nazi  firms  in  Occupied  France,  including  the  construction  of  an  aviation </p>
<p class="calibre1">fuel  refinery.  In  its  allegations  against  Standard  Oil,  the  Justice  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">repeatedly emphasized that scores of American companies had been quietly </p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalizing on relationships with  Nazi Germany. In fact, said the Justice </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  Farben  alone  had  consummated  contracts  with  more  than  100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred  American  firm,  and  that  those  efforts  had  retarded  America's  mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary preparedness by tying up patents and resources.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly  scores  of  American  firms  used  international  connections  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">trade  with  the  enemy.  None  of  them  needed  more  than  their  own  profit </p>
<p class="calibre1">motive  to  pursue  such  deals.  Many  of  them  were  proud  members  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">International  Chamber  of  Commerce,  which,  during  Watson's  tenure,  es- </p>
<p class="calibre1">poused an official enthusiasm for trade with the Hitler regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  none  of  IBM's  subsidiaries  were  on  the  Proclaimed  List  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cause  they  fell  into  a  double-edged  corporate  identity  as  "American-owned </p>
<p class="calibre1">property."  The  same  applied  to  all  American-owned  subsidiaries  in  Axis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">controlled  lands.  So  even  though  corporate  parents,  such  as  IBM,  were  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted  to  communicate  with  their  own  subsidiaries  because  they  were  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Axis  territory,  these  companies  were  deemed  American  property  to  be  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tected.  In  fact,  since  IBM  only  leased  the  machines, every  Dehomag  machine, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether deployed at the Waffen-SS office in Dachau or an insurance office in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rome, was considered American property to be protected.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence,  Dehomag  could  simultaneously  exist  as  a  U.S.  interest  and  a  tool </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Nazis  doing  business  with  the  same  Farben  and  Siemens  entities  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought other American companies utter denunciation and often prosecution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  confusion  and  inconsistency  inherent  in  the  classification  of  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries  as  "friend  or  foe"  was evident  virtually  every  time  the  matter  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">raised.  For  example,  on  June  16,  1942,  the  American  Consul  in  Bern  asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  IBM's  Swiss  subsidiary,  Watson  A.G.,  not  be  blacklisted.  "This  is  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  firm,"  wrote  the  Consul,  "and  American  interests  would  probably </p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer  should  it  be  listed.  Axis  firms  would  profit  by  the  listing  because  it  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">believed  that  they  have  in  stock  a  substantial  number  of  office  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufactured  in  Germany  and  exported  to  countries  later  occupied  by  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  and  Italy.  .  .  .  Such  machines  have  already  reached  the  Swiss  markets </p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying instructions for assembly, use, etc. in the Spanish, Yugoslav, Ruman- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ian, etc., languages. . . . This Consulate General concurs . . . that Watson A.G. </p>
<p class="calibre1">should not be listed."11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  wonder  the  British  Foreign  Office  was  increasingly  disturbed  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">America's  blacklisting  inconsistencies.  One  confidential  memo  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">British  Embassy  regarding  the  blacklist  evoked  a  handwritten  marginal  note: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  is  only  too  clear  that  where  U.S.  trade  interests  are  involved,  these  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">being  allowed  to  take  precedence  over  'hemispheric  defense,'  and  .  .  .  over </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation with us."12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  legalities  were  so  gray,  and  IBM  so  stellar  an  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">concern,  Carter  was  not  permitted  to  work  with  much  speed.  Alleging  treach- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erous business when the firm was as prominent as IBM, and its leader as well </p>
<p class="calibre1">connected  to  the  White  House  as  Watson,  was  not  to  be  undertaken  lightly </p>
<p class="calibre1">by any branch of the U.S. government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  Carter  was  unable  to  obtain  a  subpoena.  But  he  was  allowed  to  visit </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  headquarters  and  conduct  interviews  in  mid-July  1943.  To  prepare  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  visit,  Carter  typed  an  outline  with  nine  topics.  His  emphasis  was  how </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  could  not  just  lease  products  but  actually  control  its  customers.  Topic  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Carter's  typed  oudine:  "Importance  of  the  [Dehomag]  plant  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">efficient  management  of  the  German  war  machine."  Topic  2:  "Cards  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ported  from  the  United  States  per  year."  Topic  3,  with  a  checkmark:  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">source  of  raw  materials  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  possible  bottleneck </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  supplying  paper  pulp  for  the  manufacture  of  cards."  Topic  7:  "Control </p>
<p class="calibre1">exercised  by  IBM  over  their  customers  through  the  policy  of  renting  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment and the sale of cards."13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  second  list  of  ten  typed  questions  focused  stricdy  on  Dehomag  facto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ries  in  Sindelfingen  and  Lichterfelde.  Carter  wanted  to  know  about  "alpha- </p>
<p class="calibre1">betical  printers  .  .  .  why  the  sudden  interest  now."  He  also  wanted  the  "name </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  railroads"  Dehomag  worked  with,  and  the  volume  of  cards  it  produced </p>
<p class="calibre1">and had imported from IBM NY over the years.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  began  June  14,  1943,  by  interviewing  Jurriaan  W.  Schotte,  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York-based General Manager for Europe, in the company's headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Schotte,  a  Dutch  national,  was  the  firm's  European  General  Man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ager, he was permanently stationed in New York. From his office at IBM NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">headquarters,  Schotte  continued  to  regularly  maintain  communication  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM subsidiaries in Nazi territory, such as his native Holland and Belgium.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  found  Schotte  a  font  of  information.  The  interview  lasted  three </p>
<p class="calibre1">days.  During  that  time,  Carter  scribbled  copious  notes  about  IBM  customers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">uses  for  Hollerith  machines,  paper  suppliers,  biographies  of  leading  IBM  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  personalities,  and  terms  of  use.  Since  Carter  represented  the  Jus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tice  Department,  his  request  to  examine  hundreds  of  pages  of  material  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">complied with.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  perused  collections  of  documents,  allowing  him  to  piece  together </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  extraordinary  global  enterprise,  one  that  in  Europe  centered  on  Nazi  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  It  was  all  micro-managed  from  IBM's  world  headquarters.  He  saw  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">respondence,  typed  and  sometimes  handwritten,  detailing  sales,  installations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's revolt and  IBM's struggle to retain its position in the Axis. Machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">tool orders were itemized by factory, order date, and anticipated delivery </p>
<p class="calibre1">date. Quarterly financial reports and monthly narratives from subsidiaries in </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy  territory,  received  even  after  Pearl  Harbor,  relayed  the  latest  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">developments  and  the  vicissitudes  of  competitor  information.  Up-to-date </p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  account  information  enumerated  long  lists  of  machines  and  rental </p>
<p class="calibre1">prices, as well as specific war applications. Card consumption figures summa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rized  the  volume  both  by  country  of  manufacture  and  country  of  import,  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  by  year.  Most  of  all,  anyone  could  discern  the  ease  and  frequency </p>
<p class="calibre1">of contact IBM maintained with foreign branches.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  IBM  NY  possessed  a  wealth  of  detailed  information  about  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">overseas  operations,  from  CEC  to  Dehomag  to  the  units  peppered  through- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out the  Balkans.  Carter  was  able  to  type twenty-five  pages  of  notes  based just </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  his  three  days  of  interviews  with  Schotte.  A  significant  portion  of  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">notes centered  on two  aspects:  IBM's  ability  to  manage  all  aspects  of  the  rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roads  of  Europe,  from  identification  of  freight  to  scheduling,  and  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">incontrovertible control of punch cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  case  of  the  railroads,  Carter  learned  that  the  Nazis  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">schedule  cargo  or  locate  a  boxcar  or  locomotive  without  Hollerith  cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  German  government,"  Carter  wrote,  "is  at  present  partly  subsidizing </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  shipments  .  .  .  dependent  upon  IBM  machines  in  such  a  way  that  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  card  system  were  not  permitted  to  function,  the  railroads  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">unable  to  ascertain  that  portion  of  the  expense  which  the  government  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">contracted  to  bear.  .  .  .  Statistics  as  to  the  expense  to  the  railroad  of  freight </p>
<p class="calibre1">running  between  certain  points  depends  upon  the  card  system.  In  allocating </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  charges  between  railroad  systems  in  different  countries,  the  cards  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">invaluable."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  continued,  "the  location  of  the  number  of  trains  available  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">particular  territory  can  be  ascertained,  which  record  would  only  be  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  days  late.  The  only  other  method  would  be  a  spot  check  which  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  weeks  late  and,  of  course,  in  any  system  such  as  a  railroad  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendous flux of traffic, a two-week gap would be worthless."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding  punch  cards,  Carter  noted,  "In  the  manufacture  of  cards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  machinery  is  needed.  No  one  but  an  IBM  affiliate  can  make  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  because  in  Germany  the  contracts  contain  a  clause  that  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  cannot  use  cards  except  those  of  IBM  manufacture.  ...  At  present, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  paper  shortages,  stockpiles  are  probably  not  permitted  for  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">one month. The replacement requirements of cards are tremendous."20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  was  even  able  to  comprehend  IBM's  controversial  "royalty" </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement.  "A  peculiar  situation  arises  with  regard  to  the  Dehomag  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany," recorded Carter, "in that here is an almost completely owned sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary which, in addition to paying the usual stock dividend, is also required </p>
<p class="calibre1">to pay royalties to the American company. . . . However, probably, the true </p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation is that the legal limits of stock dividends prevented IBM from </p>
<p class="calibre1">getting the return it wanted from the German company, and hence this is a </p>
<p class="calibre1">method devised for additional returns."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, if he could reconstruct as much as he did with a simple request, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a full search was called for. Carter returned, this time for a systematic "file </p>
<p class="calibre1">search." But he was still hobbled by the lack of a subpoena; his superiors </p>
<p class="calibre1">would still not approve one. As such, he was dependent upon the voluntary </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation of the very people he was investigating.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In IBM's warehouse, at 75 Murray Street in Manhattan, Carter found </p>
<p class="calibre1">ten file drawers. Files were arranged alphabetically by country covering the </p>
<p class="calibre1">years 1934 to 1940. They contained correspondence relating to punch card </p>
<p class="calibre1">production, machine and parts inventories, tariff files, repair records, cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tomer complaints, lists of international fairs and visitors entertained.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But where were the key European files listing "the customer, location, </p>
<p class="calibre1">type of business, ownership ... card consumption and name of salesman" for </p>
<p class="calibre1">each machine? Most importandy, where were the "application studies," that </p>
<p class="calibre1">is, the specific analysis of each machine's purpose, how well it performed its </p>
<p class="calibre1">task, and how it could improve? Schotte's answer: all those records were </p>
<p class="calibre1">located in the offices of IBM Geneva.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where were the records for 1933? Schotte's answer: destroyed.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At IBM World Headquarters, 590 Madison Avenue, Carter first asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">for Schotte's files. But now, cooperation had substantially narrowed. Carter </p>
<p class="calibre1">was not permitted to examine the actual file drawers. Instead, Schotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought the folders into his office for Carter's review. Again, all the files were </p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged alphabetically by country. The covered years spanned 1940 to </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's most recent correspondence, containing monthly narrative reports by </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary, the details of the IBM machine installations, and "in many </p>
<p class="calibre1">instances, applications of the machines." But no "application studies" were </p>
<p class="calibre1">found for Germany, France, or Japan.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where  were  the  copies  of  Schotte's  personal  correspondence  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries?  Schotte's  answer:  none  were  in  America—they  were  all  kept  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the files of the various subsidiaries.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence,  to  examine  Schotte's  instructions,  Carter  would  have  to  travel  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">all the capitals of Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  Carter  asked  for  the  files  of  Fred  Nichol,  executive  vice  presi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dent  and  general  manager  of  IBM.  Nichol  was  second-in-command  to  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son, continuously in touch with Harrison K. Chauncey, W C. Lier, and others </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Europe,  and  had  for  years  maintained  daily  scrutiny  over  foreign  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.   Nichol's  files  were  arranged  chronologically  from  1936  to  1942,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">again  Carter  could  not  review  the  entire  file.  Carter  noted,  "I  was  not  permit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ted  to  take  the  material  from  the   general file,  but  the  material  was  chosen  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">me."  Schotte  explained  that  whatever  was  brought  out  "comprises  the  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">file on the foreign subsidiaries."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nichol's  files  contained  analyses  of  sales  performance  and  quotas,  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonnel  problems,  operating  efficiencies  at  overseas  branches,  general  records </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  business  volume,  and  details  of  foreign  visitors  including  "Good  Will </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambassadors."  Nothing  was  available  on  operations  in  Germany,  France,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">Italy that was not shown on Carter's previous visits.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,  Carter  wanted  to  see  Watson's  files.  Again,  Carter  was  not  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mitted  to  examine  the  actual  file  location.  Instead,  twenty-six  folders  cover- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  years  from  1938  to  1942  were  brought  into  Schotte's  office.  Schotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">presented  the  folders  as  "the  complete  file."  They  included  details  of  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  tour  as  ICC  president,  lists  of  top  sales  achievers,  copies  of  overseas </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  previously  given,  correspondence  involving  tax  rates  and  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary  voting  shares,  letters  from  and  about  friends  moving  from  Europe  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Americas, and exchanges of Season's Greetings.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where  was  all  of  Watson's  business  correspondence?  Schotte's  answer: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  Watson  traveled  in  Europe  extensively,  "much  of  the  business  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">transacted  orally."  If  written  materials  did  exist,  then  they  would  be  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter left IBM's offices with little. He typed a note to file: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  of  the  meager  information  contained  in  the  files,  especially  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  subsidiaries,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  either  the  important </p>
<p class="calibre1">files  are  in  the  offices  of  the  European  headquarters  in  Geneva,  Switzerland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or IBM has not made full disclosure.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALTHOUGH  WATSON  had  been  America's  chief  peace  exponent  during  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  years  before  Pearl  Harbor,  he  had  prepared  for  the  day  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  would  enter  the  conflict.  As  early  as  August  1940,  the  War  De- </p>
<p class="calibre1">partment  began  speaking  to  Watson  about  converting  IBM's  manufacturing </p>
<p class="calibre1">muscle  to  war  use—but  not  for  Holleriths.  The  War  Department  wanted  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">to make machine guns.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  31,  1941,  long  before  the  U.S.  was  attacked,  Watson  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporated a new subsidiary, Munitions Manufacturing Corporation. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">president  of  a  long-time  IBM  supplier  was  designated  president  Two  small </p>
<p class="calibre1">canning  buildings  were  purchased  for  $201,546.  Within  sixty  days  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1941  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor,  Watson  unveiled  a  fully  equipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">140,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, staffed by 250 employees. The first </p>
<p class="calibre1">product  was  a  20mm  anti-aircraft  cannon.  Eventually,  Munitions  Manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  Corporation  produced  approximately  thirty-two  different  weapons  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  military  items,  including  Browning  automatic  rifles,  gas  masks,  bomb- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sights,  90mm  anti-aircraft  gun  directors,  and  345,500  units  of  the  30-caliber </p>
<p class="calibre1">M1  carbine rifle.  IBM  logos  were  stamped  on  most of  the  products, including </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  carbine  rifle  butts.  By  1943,  eventually  two-thirds  of  IBM's  entire  factory </p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity had shifted from tabulators to munitions.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than just a manufacturer, IBM undertook sophisticated research </p>
<p class="calibre1">on ninety-nine strategic military research projects, including ballistics trajec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tory studies, aircraft design, automated inventory control, transportation </p>
<p class="calibre1">routing, aircraft fire control systems, and an advanced wireless, electronic </p>
<p class="calibre1">messaging unit called Radiotype.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  special  defense  project  involved  an  experimental  system  requested </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  Army  Air  Corps.  It  needed  a  device  that  could  read  holes  in  tele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">graphic  paper  and  translate  the  results  to  punch  cards.  Watson  was  ready  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">such a request because he had already produced a preliminary design for a </p>
<p class="calibre1">company identified as "National Analine." IBM did not complete the work for </p>
<p class="calibre1">"National  Analine"  and  instead  transferred  the  project  to  the  U.S.  military.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM also developed powerful mobile Hollerith units transported in </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-foot  rubber-padded  trailers  pulled  by  2.5-ton  tractors.  The  first  sixteen </p>
<p class="calibre1">mobile  units  were  delivered  by  spring  1942  with  more  than  260  similar  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">units  deployed  throughout  the  war.  In  the  Pacific,  mobile  Holleriths  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">hopscotched  from  one  Pacific  atoll  to  the  next.  In  the  European  theatre, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith vans were brought ashore in Tunisia and Sicily along with all other </p>
<p class="calibre1">mobile  equipment.  Understanding  their  strategic  value,  the  German  High </p>
<p class="calibre1">Command  had  issued  priority  orders  to  capture  such  a  unit,  with  its  crew,  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">possible. That never happened.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine  Record  Units  [MRUs]  were  nothing  less  than  IBM-trained </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  units  specializing  in  deploying  IBM-made  equipment.  They  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  designated  to  help  capture  any  Holleriths  discovered  in  Europe  or  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pacific theatre. A typical MRU detachment was  staffed by twenty-nine </p>
<p class="calibre1">enlisted  men  and  three  officers  proficient  in  punch  card  operations.  To  churn </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  the  MRUs,  IBM's  school  at  Endicott  was  converted  into  a  military  acad- </p>
<p class="calibre1">emy  where  about  1,300  soldiers  were  trained  to  use  Holleriths  under  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions. Many of these units were commanded and serviced by IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  on  leave.  They  formed  a  cohesive  group  of  troops,  affectionately </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  "IBM  Soldiers",  with  distinct  loyalties  to  their  company  and  Watson.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">These IBM Soldiers would have special roles when they came upon  IBM fac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tories in Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  coordinate  IBM's  dozens  of  war  projects  for  the  U.S.,  Watson  cre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  his  own  corporate  "Department  of  Logistics."  This  company  bureau </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  IBM  focus  its  resources  on  some  of  America's  most  sensitive  military </p>
<p class="calibre1">projects.  Watson  appointed  IBM  General  Manager  Nichol  head  of  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">department.  Ironically,  Nichol  was  at  the  same  time  overseeing  IBM's  foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations  in  Nazi  Europe.  Watson  explained  that  Nichol  "is  eminendy  fitted </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  this  important  work  by  reason  of  his  broad  executive  experience  ...  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bined  with  military  knowledge."  He  added,  "He  has  intimate  knowledge  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign industrial methods and resources."39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  its  technology  were  in  fact  involved  in  the  Allies'  most  top- </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret  operations.  The  Enigma  code  crackers  at  Bletchley  Park  in  England </p>
<p class="calibre1">used  Hollerith  machines  supplied  by  IBM's  British  licensee,  the  British  Tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lating Machine Company. Hut 7 at Bletchley Park was known as the Tabulating </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine  Section.  As  early  as  January  1941,  the  British  Tabulating  Machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">Company  was  supplying  machines  and  punch  cards  not  only  to  Bletchley </p>
<p class="calibre1">Park, but to British intelligence units in Singapore and Cairo as well.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  May  1942,  IBM  employees  had  joined  America's  own  cryptographic </p>
<p class="calibre1">service.  A  key  man  was  Steve  Dunwell,  who  left  Endicott's  Commercial  Re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">search  Department  to  join  other  code  breakers  in  Washington,  D.C.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">group  used  a  gamut  of  punch  card  machines  made  by  IBM  as  well  as  Rem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ington  Rand  to  decipher  intercepted  Axis  messages.  Captured  enemy  code </p>
<p class="calibre1">books  were  keyed  into  punch  cards  using  overlapping  strings  of  fifty  digits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  punched  cards  were  sorted.  Each  deciphered  word  was  used  to  attack </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  word  until  a  message's  context  and  meaning  could  laboriously  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">established.  At  one  point,  Dunwell  needed  a  special  machine  with  electro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanical  relays  that  could  calculate  at  high  speed  the  collective  probability </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  words  that  might  appear  in  a  theoretical  message  bit.  Dunwell  sought  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mission  from  Watson  to  ask  that  the  device  be  assembled  at  IBM.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">granted  it.  Later,  Watson  rewarded  Dunwell  for  his  service  to  the  nation  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing  him  to  spend  his  honeymoon  in  Watson's  personal  suite  at  the  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Country Club.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  an  irony  of  the  war  that  IBM  equipment  was  used  to  encode  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">decode for both sides of the conflict.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  there  even  when  the  Allies  landed  at  Normandy  on  June  6, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944. Hollerith machines were continuously used by the Weather Division of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Army Air Forces to monitor and predict t h e  tempestuous storms afflicting </p>
<p class="calibre1">the English Channel. When A l l i e d  troops finally landed at Normandy, MRUs </p>
<p class="calibre1">went in soon after the beachhead was secured.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">War  had  always  been  good  to  IBM.  In  America,  war  income  was  with- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out equal. Within ninety days of Pearl Harbor, Watson was able to inform the </p>
<p class="calibre1">media  that  IBM  had  secured  more  than  $150  million  in  munitions  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">defense  contracts.  Total  wartime  sales  and  rentals  tripled  from  approximately </p>
<p class="calibre1">$46  million  annually  in  1940  to  approximately  $140  million  annually  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  machines  were  not  just  used  to  wage  war.  They  were  also  used  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">track  people.  Holleriths  organized  millions  for  the  draft.  Allied  soldiers  miss- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  in  action,  as  well  as  captured  Axis  prisoners,  were  cataloged  by  IBM  sys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tems.  The  location  of  every  serviceman  anywhere  in  the  world,  from  George </p>
<p class="calibre1">S.  Patton  to  the  most  anonymous  buck  private,  could  be  determined  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">punching  a  request  into  a  Hollerith.  All  military  payments  were  automated </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  continuously  distributed  by  IBM  tabulators.  A  National  Roster  of  Scien- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tific and Specialized Personnel was assembled to aid in the war effort.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  central  reason  IBM  machines  could  yield  such  extraordinary  people </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking  capabilities  in  America  arose  from  its  extensive  use  in  the  1940  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus.  This  census  asked  a  number  of  detailed,  personal  questions.  A  national </p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign  of  gentle  persuasion  was  launched  to  convince  people  to  provide </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  answers.  In  one  radio  address,  First  Lady  Eleanor  Roosevelt  promoted </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  1940  census  as  "the  greatest  assemblage  of  facts  ever  collected  by  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  about  the  things  that  affect  their  welfare."  She  acknowledged,  "Much </p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt  has  been  raised  as  to  the  propriety  of  some  of  the  questions."  But,  she </p>
<p class="calibre1">added,  they  were  designed  to  yield  "facts  which  will  provide  illuminating </p>
<p class="calibre1">data on problems which have become particularly pressing."46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Sunday,  December  7,  1941,  Japan  attacked  Pearl  Harbor.  Within </p>
<p class="calibre1">forty-eight  hours,  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  published  its  first  report  on  Japa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nese Americans entitled Japanese Population of the United States, Its Territories </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Possessions. The next day it published Japanese Population by Nativity and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Citizenship in Selected Cities of the United States. On December 10, it released </p>
<p class="calibre1">a third report, Japanese Population in the Pacific Coast States by Sex, Nativity </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Citizenship, by Counties. Using IBM applications, the Census Bureau had </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracked  the  racial  ancestry  of  Japanese  Americans  based  on  their  responses </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the 1940 census.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Census  Director  J.  C.  Capt  confirmed,  "we  didn't  wait  for  the  [Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can]  declaration  of  war  [which  was  proclaimed  Monday  afternoon,  Decem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber 8]. On Monday morning, we put our people to work on the Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing."  Since only  135,430 Japanese  Americans lived  in  the  United  States, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">results were tabulated quickly. A single sort was necessary: race.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divulging  specific  addresses  was  illegal.  So  the  Census  Bureau  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vided  information  that  located  Japanese-American  concentration  within  spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cific  census  tracts.  Census  tracts  were  geographic  areas  generally  yielding </p>
<p class="calibre1">4,000  to  8,000  citizens.  When  necessary,  the  Census  Bureau  could  provide </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  finer  detail:  so-called  "enumeration  districts,"  and  in  some  cities  "census </p>
<p class="calibre1">blocks."  With  this  information,  the  American  government  could  focus  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">search  in  select  communities  along  the  West  Coast—even  if  it  did  not  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">the exact names and addresses.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  Census  Bureau  official  explained  to  a  federal  commission  that  he  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">happy  to  provide  "a  detailed  cross-tabulation  for  even  the  most  minute  areas </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  for  which  data  were  collected.  In  other  words,  enumeration  districts  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  some  instances  cities  by  blocks.  .  .  .  Sheets  of  paper  from  the  tabulation </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  were  sent  out  to  WCCA  [Wartime  Civil  Control  Administration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  was  responsible  for  the  internment]  .  .  .  and  became  the  basis  for  the </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  maps  displaying  Japanese  population  density  were  marked  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">dots,  one  for  each  ten  persons.  American  and  Dutch  census  bureaus  simulta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">neously used Hollerith systems in 1943 to create racial "dot maps" as a means </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  organizing  transfers  to  concentration  camps.  Hollerith  experts  dedicated </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  such  projects  seemed  to  work  according  to  an  established  protocol  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">either  side  of  the  Adantic,  almost  as  though  they  had  the  same  consultant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz  and  his  colleagues  published  highly  detailed  articles  describing  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">registration  programs.  These  articles  appeared  not  only  in  Dutch  statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">journals,  but  were  translated  into  German  for  the  journal  of  the  German  Sta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tistical  Society,  and  then  translated  into  English  for  the  journal  of  the  Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can Statistical Association. The Journal of the American Statistical Association </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  regularly  read  by  everyone  in  the  American  statistical  community  as  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">as the engineers and consultants at IBM.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  locating  the  Japanese  by  census  block  was  insufficient,  the  Census </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bureau  was  willing  to  take  the  next  step  to  deliver  actual  names  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">addresses.  "We're  by  law  required  to  keep  confidential  information  by  indi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">viduals,"  Census  Director  Capt  declared  at  the  time.  He  added,  "But  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">end,  [i]f  the  defense  authorities  found  200  Japs  missing  and  they  wanted  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">names  of  the  Japs  in  that  area,  I  would  give  them  further  means  of  checking </p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals."52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  February  19,  1942,  President  Roosevelt  could  confidently  sign  Exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utive Order 9066 authorizing the internment of Japanese Americans on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">West Coast. On March 22, 1942, the evacuations began in Los Angles. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Supreme  Court  later  upheld  the  legality  of  such  a  measure  based  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestral grounds alone.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  on  April  29,  1945,  an  all-Japanese-American  regiment  helped </p>
<p class="calibre1">free Dachau.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas  Watson  was  more  than  the  leader  of  one  of  America's  most  val- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ued  wartime  corporations.  He  seized  the  opportunity  to  become  the  nation's </p>
<p class="calibre1">chief  industrial  patriot.  Just  as  he  had  sermonized  for  peace  during  the  thir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  and  early  years  of  war  before  America's  entry,  Watson  now  epitomized </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  loyal  warrior  capitalist.  As  early  as  January  1941,  Watson  had  assured  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porters,   "The  leaders  of  government,  business  and  industry  to  whom  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">execution  of  our  defense  program  has  been  entrusted  will  have  the  loyal </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  of  every  businessman  in  the  United  States.  We  are  willing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  sacrifices  to  achieve  this,  because  we  appreciate  our  privileges  as  Amer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ican  citizens  and  will  always  stand  together  in  defense  of  our  form  of  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment  and  our  American  ideals,  while  also  endeavoring  to  assist  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate with all right-thinking people throughout the world."55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Independence  Day,  1941,  Watson  reported  that  during  the  previous </p>
<p class="calibre1">six  weeks  he  had  helped  stage  theatrical  performances  for  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">650,000  American  soldiers  and  sailors  stationed  at  sixty  posts.  As  chairman </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Citizens  Committee  for  the  Army  and  Navy,  Watson  raised  funds </p>
<p class="calibre1">among  major  industrialists  to  entertain  the  troops.  This  included  a  substan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tial donation of his own.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  15,  1941,  Watson  declared,  "We  are  a  peace-loving  people  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">we love peace to such an extent that we are willing to fight for it. We cherish </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  civilization  in  this  country  above  everything  else  and  we  are  going  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">adequately prepared to protect it and to continue to develop it."57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  October  1941,  Watson's  Citizens  Committee  helped  Eleanor  Roose- </p>
<p class="calibre1">velt organize a  "Knit for Defense" tea  at the  Waldorf-Astoria.  At the  event,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced the First Lady as "the first knitter."58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  1941,  even  as  Watson  was  broadcasting  jingoistic  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  and  organizing  patriotic  services,  he  was  also  waging  his  own  private </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  against  the  Dehomag  revolt.  However,  his  struggle  to  remain  in  the  Axis </p>
<p class="calibre1">war machine did not deter him from continuing to mobilize America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1942,  Watson  purchased  full-page  display  ads  in  leading  newspapers </p>
<p class="calibre1">proclaiming his great "WE-ALL." The few lines of large type beneath the head- </p>
<p class="calibre1">line  "WE-ALL"  exhorted:  "Our  slogan  now  is  WE-ALL,  which  means  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">loyal  individual  in  the  United  States.  We  are  facing  a  long,  hard  job,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">when the United States decides to fight for a cause, it is in terms of WE-ALL, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and nothing can or will stop us. President Roosevelt, our Commander-in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chief,  can  be  certain  that  WE-ALL  are  back  of  him,  determined  to  protect </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  country,  our  form  of  government,  and  the  freedoms  which  we  cherish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  advertisements  bore  the  thick,  swashing  signature  of  Thomas  J.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">as "President, International Business Machines Corporation."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  patriotic  crusade  never  diminished  in  fervor.  It  wasn't  just  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate. It was personal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1943,  as  Harold  J.  Carter  sat  in  IBM's  offices  at  590  Madison </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avenue,  he  was  investigating  more  than  a  powerful  business.  Carter  never </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  a  chance.  He  was  going  against  a  corporation  that  was  intensely  vital  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  every  aspect  of  the  U.S.  war  effort,  including  its  most  secret  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions,  and  against  executives  who  occupied  the  glittering  apex  of  America's </p>
<p class="calibre1">rally  for  defense.  In  fact,  Watson  had  even  declined  a  recent  Democratic  sug- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gestion  to  run  for  Governor  of  New  York.60  No  wonder  Schotte  could  decide </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  documents  Carter  would  and  would  not  receive.  IBM  and  Watson  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">untouchable.  Carter  learned  the  immutable  truth  in  the  very  words  he  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">written months earlier: </p>
<p class="calibre1">This [World War] is a conflict of warlike nationalistic states, each having cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  interests.  Yet  we  frequently  find  these  interests  clashing  diametrically </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  opposing  interests  of  international  corporate  structures,  more  huge </p>
<p class="calibre1">and powerful than nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  in  some  ways  bigger  than  the  war.  Both  sides  could  not  afford </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  proceed  without  the  company's  all-important  technology.  Hitler  needed </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM. So did the Allies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  late  1943,  Carter  learned  that  whether  he  concurred  or  not,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  to  be  treated  as  a  suspect  corporation  trading  with  the  enemy,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  a  precious  war  asset  in  the  Allied  struggle  for  liberty.  IBM  now  entered  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">wholly  new  phase.  Since  all  of  Nazi  Europe  administratively  functioned  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holleriths,  IBM's  help  would  be  crucial  to  the  post-war  control  of  Europe's </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrative  and  economic  infrastructure.  Simply  put:  IBM  had  the  keys  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe—or  rather  the  cards.  Now,  all  its  expertise  in  punch  card  technol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ogy  would  be  utilized  to  create  an  orderly  conquest  and  liberation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter's  Economic  Warfare  Section  now  regularly  turned  to  IBM  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">learn  the  many  intricacies  of  German  and  Italian  Hollerith  use—not  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">purposes  of  criminal  prosecution  or  documenting  culpability,  but  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">purposes of military intelligence and sustaining Allied victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  December  1943  Carter  prepared  a  memo  entitled  "Use  of  Mecha- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ni zed  Accounting  Systems  in  Axis  and  Axi s  Occupied  Territory"  based  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pletely  on  information  gleaned  from  Schotte  and  other  IBM  executives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter's  focus  had  now  shifted,  recording  the  details  of  Hollerith  deployment </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Nazi  Holland,  Germany,  and  Italy,  including  the  street  addresses  of  major </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  processing  agencies  and  repositories.  For  example,  his  memo  pin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed the Ministry of Corporations at Via Vittorio Veneto in Rome as main- </p>
<p class="calibre1">taining  "complete  records  in  punch  card  form  of  all  Italian  industrial </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial,  transportation,  and  agricultural  enterprises,  together  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">employment  and  vocational  records  of  all  personnel  engaged  in  these  enter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">prises.  By  putting  the  punched  cards  and  business  machines  at  this  location </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  use,  it  would  be  possible  to  secure  quickly  and  accurately"  a  long  list  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">operational information needed to control a post-war occupied Italy.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  memo  similarly  listed  key  data  bureaus  in  Holland  and  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  stressed  that  IBM  subsidiaries  supplied  and  helped  organize  all  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy  installations.  He  closed  with  the  observation:  "In  order  to  utilize  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">data  located  in  the  governmental  agencies  described  above,  it  is  suggested </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  special  measures  be  instituted  in  conjunction  with  the  military  authori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties to seize and safeguard the punch cards and business machines in these </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices.  These  measures  might  include  the  constituting  of  a  special  unit  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">detailed knowledge of the applications of business machines and punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards . . . and a prearranged plan of action."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  Carter's  colleagues,  Harold  Ungar,  prepared  another  confidential </p>
<p class="calibre1">memo  further  outlining  the  new  approach.  'The  German  Government,"  wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ungar,  "through  the  intensive  use  of  standardized  accounting  practices  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  machines,  has  achieved  a  highly  centralized  control  of  the  financial </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  industrial  activities  of  Germany  and  of  the  occupied  countries.  This  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trol  is  so  centralized  that  a  sudden  collapse  of  the  German  Government  may </p>
<p class="calibre1">produce  such  chaos  in  the  functioning  of  the  German  economy  as  to  make </p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely  difficult  whatever  administration  the  Allied  authorities  may  seek  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">impose [after the war]. Whatever system the occupation authorities intend </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  adopt,  therefore,  one  action  with  high  priority  is  to  prepare  in  advance  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">seize and utilize the existing German economic control apparatus."63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  come  full  circle.  The  firm  had  now  become  a  strategic  partner </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  war  against  the  Third  Reich—even  as  it  continuously  supplied  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy,  as  before,  through  its  overseas  subsidiaries.  Carter's  investigation  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">finished. The crusade to save the machines was on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carter  now  produced  memo  after  memo—hundreds  of  pages—de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tailing the inner workings of Dehomag, Watson Italiana, and the way the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third  Reich  ran  railroads  and  organized  military  operations  across  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">using  punch  cards.  The  complete  blueprint  of  Nazi  Germany  Holleriths  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">documented.  His  investigative  reports  were  converted  into  operational  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uals  for  both  invasion  forces  and  the  civilian  administrators  who  would  fol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">low.  As  late  as  June  1944,  Carter's  section  was  even  able  to  learn  from  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  executive  that  critical  economic  policy  files  of  the  Nazi  Party  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">reduced  to  punch  cards  which  could  be  reconstructed  if  recovered.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew where they were: in Veesenmayer's office.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  Allies,  IBM  assistance  came  at  a  crucial  point.  But  for  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Europe  it  was  too  late.  Hitler's  Holleriths  had  been  deployed  against  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  almost  a  decade  and  were  continuing  without  abatement.  Millions  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  would  now  suffer  the  consequences  of  being  identified  and  processed </p>
<p class="calibre1">by IBM technologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  nearly  a  decade  of  incremental  solutions  the  Third  Reich  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  to  launch  the  last  stage.  In  January  1942,  a  conference  was  held  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wannsee  outside  Berlin.  This  conference,  supported  by  Reich  statisticians </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hollerith  experts,  would  outline  the  Final  Solution  of  the  Jewish  prob- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lem  in  Europe.  Once  more,  Holleriths  would  be  used,  but  this  time  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  not  be  sent  away  from  their  offices  or  congregated  into  ghettos.  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  was  now  ready  for  mass  shooting  pits,  gas  chambers,  crematoria,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  ambitious  Hollerith-driven  program  known  as  "extermination  by  labor" </p>
<p class="calibre1">where Jews were systematically worked to death like spent matches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  Jews  of  Europe,  it  was  their  final  encounter  with  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">automation. </p>
