  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">To achieve his goals, each man had to cooperate in an international </p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign of corporate schizophrenia designed to achieve maximum deniability </p>
<p class="calibre1">for both Dehomag and IBM. The storyline depended upon the circumstance </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the listener. Dehomag could be portrayed as the American-controlled, al- </p>
<p class="calibre1">most wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM with token German shareholders and </p>
<p class="calibre1">on-site German managers. Or Dehomag could be a loyal German, staunchly </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aryan company baptized in the blood of Nazi ideology wielding the power </p>
<p class="calibre1">of its American investment for the greater glory of Hitler's Reich. Indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger and Watson both were willing to wave either banner as needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both stories were true. Watson had seen to that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  Aryan  facade  was  carefully  constructed.  In  newly  Nazified </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  many  good  and  decent  businessmen  looked  the  other  way,  dread- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  day  stern-faced  men  sporting  swastika  armbands  knocked  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">door  demanding  anti-Semitic  loyalty  oaths,  subscriptions  of  financial  sup- </p>
<p class="calibre1">port,  and  ultimately  invasive  Party  control  via  kommissars.  At  the  same  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  could  not  wait  to  join  the  movement.  Dehomag  was  among  those  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">could not wait. IBM was among those who did not mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Early  on,  Heidinger  sought  out  the  sponsorship  of  the  Nazi  Party  hier- </p>
<p class="calibre1">archy.  He  wanted  Dehomag  draped  in  the  authority  not  only  of  the  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  but  the  Nazi  Party  itself.  However,  before  the  NSDAP  would  ally  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag,  the  powerful  Political  and  Economics  Division  demanded,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1933,  that  the  company  answer  some  pointed  questions.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party's  probe  was  designed  to  detect  just  who  controlled  the  corporation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  the  firm  was  German  enough,  Nazi  enough,  and  strategic  enough  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">receive the Party's seal of approval.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  proffered  incisive,  if  dubious,  written  replies.  "My  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  an  entirely  independent  organization  which  has  acquired  patent  rights </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  their  American  owners,"  he  insisted,  and  is  merely  bound  to  pay  "royal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties."  But,  argued  Heidinger,  "any  worries  as  to  whether  or  not  excessive </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts  of  German  funds  are  being  exported  are  thoroughly  unjustified," </p>
<p class="calibre1">especially  since  most  of  the  royalties  remained  in  blocked  German  bank </p>
<p class="calibre1">accounts until released by the government.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  Party  question  inquired  why  Dehomag  could  not  sell  any  wholly </p>
<p class="calibre1">German-built  office  equipment  instead  of  American  products.  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">explained  that  the  Reich  could  not  achieve  its  goals  without  Hollerith  tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors.  "[A]side  from  ours,  no  other  punched  card  machinery  is  manufactured </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Germany,"  asserted  Heidinger,  adding,  "Our  machines  cannot  possibly </p>
<p class="calibre1">displace  other  machines,  because  the  work  they  are  called  upon  to  perform </p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot be accomplished by the other machines."10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  concluded  his  written  comments  by  reminding  the  Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">examiners  that  Dehomag  had  been  "entrusted  .  .  .  with  the  compilation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics  for  the  Prussian  census."  He  added  knowingly,  with  that  air  of  omi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nous  lack  of  specificity  so  common  in  those  days,  "Moreover,  negotiations </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  now  pending  in  Berlin,  their  object  being  an  agreement  between  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  and  the  SA  [Storm  Troopers]  high  command  in  that  city  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">compilation  of  certain  necessary  statistics."11  Nothing  more  need  be  said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag was approved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Verbatim  translations  of  the  NSDAP's  questions  and  Heidinger's  answers </p>
<p class="calibre1">- along with the German originals—were delivered to the New York office </p>
<p class="calibre1">within several business days for review by Watson and other IBM executives.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  agreed  with  a  sub-rosa  approach  if  it  could  garner  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party  affiliation  needed  to  secure  more  government  contracts.  IBM  willingly </p>
<p class="calibre1">diminished  its  own  identity  as  part  of  the  effort.  New  York  executives  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">advised  of  a  Dehomag  request:  "in  the  future,  on  all  machines  shipped  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  [Dehomag],  the  following  designations  are  to  be  omitted:  1)  Interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  Business  Machines,  2)  International."  A  1934  memo  from  IBM's  Paris </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers  didn't  even  want  IBM  billed  for  small  German  registration  fees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">explaining,  "we  all  should  be  very  careful  in  exploiting  or  advertising  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">name  of  IBM  Corp.  in  Germany."13  Watson  himself  would  continue  his  high </p>
<p class="calibre1">visibility,  but  would  be  portrayed  during  his  frequent  visits  not  as  a  foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">controller  of  Dehomag  as  much  as  a  supporter  of  IBM  technology  in  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger's assertions of allegiance to Nazi ethics and independence </p>
<p class="calibre1">from foreign influence were certainly acceptable to IBM in New York—so </p>
<p class="calibre1">long as everyone in the company understood the truth: Watson remained in </p>
<p class="calibre1">charge. To ensure that Watson in fact retained full control of Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">activities, IBM NY insisted on several provisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  Dehomag  by-laws  would  allow  New  York  to  supercede  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  of  directors  at  any  time.  Dehomag's  corporate  by-laws  five  and  six  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clared that the corporation would be comprised not only of shareholders and a </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  of  directors,  but  of  an  unusual  third  component:  "representatives  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorneys—in-fact...  determined  by  the  shareholders."  These  would  be  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">accountants,  managers,  and  lawyers  who could  project  Watson's authority on a </p>
<p class="calibre1">day-to-day  basis.  The  fifth  by-law  added,  "The  shareholders  shall  be  in  a  po- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sition  to  annul  the  board  of  directors."  By-law  seven  ordered,  "The  represen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tatives  [Watson's  attorneys  and  accountants]  shall  follow  the  instructions  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the shareholders and the board of directors, if there is one."14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  Heidinger's  token  10  percent  share  of  the  Dehomag  were  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  own,  but  only  so  long  as  he  remained  with  the  company.  The  stock  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  be  sold  without  the  shareholders'  permission,  according  to  by-law  four.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  the  power  at  Dehomag  was  wielded  by  the  shareholders.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  and  IBM  NY  owned  90  percent  of  the  stock.  This  gave  Watson  and  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorneys veto power over any Dehomag activity and indeed over Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  also  wanted  his  own  people  on  the  Dehomag  board  to  counter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">balance Heidinger. Representing IBM NY were trusted Watson represen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tatives  Walter  Dickson  Jones,  who  operated  out  of  IBM's  Paris  office,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">John  K.  Holt,  who  mainly  operated  out  of  IBM's  Geneva  office.16  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">acquiesced  to  the  concept  of  foreign  control,  but  he  resented  Watson's  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ference.  The  first  test  came  quickly.  It  involved  German  Sales  Manager  Karl </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  cultivated  a  personal  alliance  with  Hummel.  He  had  ar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ranged  for  Hummel  to  attend  IBM's  sales  training  school  at  Endicott,  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  and  entertained  Hummel  and  his  wife  in  his  home.  The  Hummels  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watsons  periodically  exchanged  gifts.  Watson  knew  how  to  develop  loyalty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  Hummel  on  the  German  board.  December  15,  1933,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  his  move,  sending  a  radiogram  to  Dehomag  General  Manager  Her- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mann  Rottke:  "To  give  Dehomag  fuller  representation  in  Germany,  I  request </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Karl  Hummel  be  made  second  director  (Geschaftsfuhrer)  and  his  name </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  listed.  .  .  .  Kindly  notify  me  when  this  is  done."17  Watson  had  not  asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  erupted,  and  just  days  before  the  new  factory  was  to  open </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  grand  ceremony,  Rottke  cabled  back:  "According  to  German  law,  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  but  only  shareholders  meeting  and  board  of  directors  have  authority  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">promote  Karl  Hummel  .  .  .  sending  your  cable  and  a  copy  of  this  answer </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Heidinger."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarcastic  and  threatening,  Heidinger  on  December  20  dashed  off  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">warning  to  Watson.  "I  do  not  seriously  fear  ...  your  positive  will  in  the  future </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  put  me  aside  in  questions  of  importance  for  the  Dehomag.  Nevertheless,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  course  feel  deeply  depressed  that  you  are  not  interested  to  hear  my  opin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ion  [about]  ...  such  an  important  decision....  That  feeling  of  depression  ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  be  considered  as  not  important.  But  what  could  be  important  is  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">following.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As  you  know,"  Heidinger  continued,  "we  all  considered  it  of  greatest </p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  to  proof  [sic]  that  the  Dehomag  is  a  German-managed  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  free  from  American  influence  .  .  .  our  authorities  are  very  sensitive  if  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">should  believe  to  be  fouled."  He  hinted  that  the  Nazi  Party  might  feel  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">need  to  install  two  of  its  own  kommissars  on  the  board.  During  a  recent  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ference  at  the  Nazi  Party  headquarters,  Heidinger  had  reassured  ranking </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  that  Dehomag  would  function  free  of  American  influence.  Now  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel  appointment  was  showing  the  opposite,  he  claimed,  adding  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  move  would  "shock"  Party  stalwarts  and  create  a  "dangerous"  situa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion for the company.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson went into damage control mode. Upon receiving Heidinger's irk- </p>
<p class="calibre1">some missive, he cabled Rottke, who would soon sail to America lor meetings </p>
<p class="calibre1">at IBM: "Do nothing further about Hummel until I see you in New York."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was difficult, but Watson humbled himself. In a rambling, two-page </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter filled with spelling errors, Watson apologized over and over again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">regretted Heidinger's upset, professed his unqualified friendship to Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many, recalled his pleasant times in Berlin, enumerated his forthcoming din- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner engagements with the German ambassador, and staunchly assured, "you </p>
<p class="calibre1">have nothing to worry about in connection with the German government, so </p>
<p class="calibre1">far as my connection with our German business is concerned." Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">blamed not his lack of respect for Heidinger, but a simple typo. In his origi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nal cablegram asking for Hummel's appointment, Watson averred, "one word </p>
<p class="calibre1">was misquoted. The cablegram dictated was 'I suggest,' and I find in the copy </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was written "request' ... it is always my policy ... to make a suggestion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than a request."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suggest. Not request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unappeased, Heidinger shot back in a melodramatic flourish, "it was a </p>
<p class="calibre1">real and great joy for me to receive your letter . . . [and] to see that the </p>
<p class="calibre1">biggest part of the trouble arose from the mistake of using the word 'request' </p>
<p class="calibre1">instead [of] 'suggest' which ... formally settles the most dangerous point. .. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hardly can express how happy I am about the friendly manner in which you </p>
<p class="calibre1">explain... the mistaken wording of your cable."23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger's message was cabled to Rottke, who at that moment was </p>
<p class="calibre1">steaming across the Atlantic on the SS President Roosevelt. Rottke had the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable retyped on letterhead and handed it to Watson once he landed in New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York. Hummel, it was decided, would be promoted to senior management, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but not sit on the board. The conflict was over. Watson filed his original dic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tation copy of that December cablegram to Rottke. On line two the word </p>
<p class="calibre1">"request" was   originally  typed.   Watson  edited   the  cable,   scratched  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">"request" but then upon reflection wrote it back in by hand and signed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suggest" was never in the document. It was always "request."24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">JANUARY_8,1934. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  corner  of  Dehomag's  vast  punch  card  operation  within  the  great </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karstadthaus  census  complex  at  Berlin's  Alexanderplatz,  with  morning  light </p>
<p class="calibre1">streaming  in  behind  them  through  banks  of  tall  parallel  windows,  several </p>
<p class="calibre1">dozen officials of the Prussian Statistical Office were joined by leaders of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi Party in full uniform and Dehomag officials in their finest suits to </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">solemnly recognize the coming revolution of data processing and the newly </p>
<p class="calibre1">forged al li ance with International Business Machines.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hands  reverently  clasped  either  behind  their  backs  or  across  their  belt </p>
<p class="calibre1">buckles,  shoulders  and  arms  touching  in  fellowship,  the  assemblage  stood  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">awe  of  this  day,  the  day  Germany  would  unveil  its  own  factory  producing </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  machines.  The  President  of  the  Prussian  Statistical  Office,  Dr.  Hop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ker,  delivered  brief  remarks  using  the  euphemisms  and  crystal  clear  ambigui- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  of  the  day.  "[T]he  irresistible  force  of  the  National  Socialist  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  demands  the  [census]  results  faster  than  ever  before,"  he  declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">adding,  "German  statistics  understands  this  impatience."  He  then  explained </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly  how  the  punch  card  process  worked,  distilling  the  anonymous  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  masses  into  specific  names  organized  by  race  and  religion,  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous other characteristics.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accompanied  by  a  dense  din  in  adjacent  halls  that  clicked  and  whirred </p>
<p class="calibre1">like  locusts  swarming  a  field,  Heidinger  stepped  to  the  front  to  speak.  With </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  passion  of  a  die-hard  ideologist  simultaneously  presenting  an  omnipotent </p>
<p class="calibre1">gift  to  the  nation  and  fulfilling  a  life-long  personal  dream,  he  spoke  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">demographic surgery the German population required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  physician  examines  the  human  body  and  determines  whether  ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  organs  are  working  to  the  benefit  of  the  entire  organism,"  asserted  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  to  a  crowd  of  company  employees  and  Nazi  officials.  "We  [Dehomag] </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  very  much  like  the  physician,  in  that  we  dissect,  cell  by  cell,  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">cultural  body.  We  report  every  individual  characteristic  ...  on  a  little  card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  are  not  dead  cards,  quite  to  the  contrary,  they  prove  later  on  that  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">come  to  life  when  the  cards  are  sorted  at  a  rate  of  25,000  per  hour  according </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  certain  characteristics.  These  characteristics  are  grouped  like  the  organs  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  cultural  body,  and  they  will  be  calculated  and  determined  with  the  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">of our tabulating machine.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  are  proud  that  we  may  assist  in  such  a  task,  a  task  that  provides  our </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation's  Physician  [Adolf  Hitler]  with  the  material  he  needs  for  his  examina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  Our  Physician  can  then  determine  whether  the  calculated  values  are  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">harmony  with  the  health  of  our  people.  It  also  means  that  if  such  is  not  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">case,  our  Physician  can  take  corrective  procedures  to  correct  the  sick  circum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stances.  .  .  .  Our  characteristics  are  deeply  rooted  in  our  race.  Therefore,  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">must  cherish  them  like  a  holy  shrine,  which  we  will—and  must—keep  pure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  have  the  deepest  trust  in  our  Physician  and  will  follow  his  instructions  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">blind  faith,  because  we  know  that  he  will  lead  our  people  to  a  great  future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hail to our German people and der Fuhrer!"28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entire group then filed out of the massive building and motored to </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  new  factory  in  the  quiet  Berlin  section  of  Lichterfelde  to  attend  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">official opening. At  10:30, Dehomag employees stopped thei r  work to gather </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  great  event.  Tall  trees  along  the  perimeter  were  still  nearly  barren </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  Berlin  winter.  The  swastika-bedecked  square  in  front  of  the  four- </p>
<p class="calibre1">story  factory  complex  was  already  jammed  with  hundreds  of  neighborhood </p>
<p class="calibre1">onlookers and well wishers.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  before  noon,  two  columns  of  Storm  Troopers  took  up  positions </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  either  side  of  the  walkway  leading  to  Dehomag's  front  door.  A  band </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  SA's  9th  Regiment  played  Nazi  victory  songs.  Finally,  the  NSDAP </p>
<p class="calibre1">hierarchy arrived.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  had  invited  Nazi  higher-ups  representing  the  organizations </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  important  to  the  future  of  IBM's  partnership  with  the  Third  Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  German  Labor  Front  came  Rudolf  Schmeer,  a  last-minute  stand-in </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Dr.  Robert  Ley,  leader  of  the  organization.  The  German  Labor  Front  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  militant  coalition  responsible  for  mobilizing  unemployed  Nazi  millions </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  both  newly  created  jobs  and  vacated  Jewish  positions.  The  Front  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">inducted  Germans  into  regimented  squads  that  functioned  as  veritable  mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  units.  So  important  was  Dr.  Ley  and  his  German  Labor  Front  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  Lichterfelde  factory  opening  was  delayed  two  days  because  he  took  ill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  when  it  became  clear  he  would  not  recover  for  days  was  the  event  sud- </p>
<p class="calibre1">denly  rescheduled  with  Schmeer,  accompanied  by  an  entourage  of  poten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tates, </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing </p>
<p class="calibre1">in.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Schmeer's  side  was  A.  Gorlitzer  representing  the  SA,  the  rough  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  Storm  Troopers,  the  violent  edge  of  Hitler's  forces.  Gorlitzer  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful  Nazi.  When  Goebbels  became  Propaganda  Minister,  Gorlitzer  took </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  place  in  the  Storm  Trooper  organization.  Now,  the  presence  of  Gorlitzer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  gleaming,  black  leather  boots  and  fighting  uniform,  would  testify  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">importance of Dehomag in Hitler's future plans.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  invited  Nazi  officials  paraded  through  echelons  of  honor  guard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Brown  Shirts  pumped  their  arms  rigidly  diagonal.  Schmeer,  Gorlitzer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  other  leaders  returned  the  disciplined  Hitler  salute  with  a  casual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  cocky  bent-elbowed  gesture,  their  open  palms  barely  wafting  over </p>
<p class="calibre1">their shoulder.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bouquets    decorated  Dehomag's  reception  hall.  One  large  swastika </p>
<p class="calibre1">emblem  dominated  the  front  of  the  podium,  and  an  even  larger  swastika  flag </p>
<p class="calibre1">hung  across  the  wall.  Music  inside  was  provided  by  an  NSDAP  men's  choir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To record the event, a tall, circular microphone stood nearby.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company's  most  important  users  were  there  as  well.  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">guest list included the directors of the Reichsbank and other financial institu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions,  the  Police  Post  Office,  Ministry  of  Defense  Reich,  Reich  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office,  and  an  executive  contingent  from  the  Reichsbahn,  that  is,  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railway.35  The  future  was  in  the  cards—a  future  of  names,  of  police  files  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration  camps,  of  bank  accounts  and  asset  transfers,  of  war  offices  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons  production,  of  endless  statistical  campaigns  and  registrations,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  trains.  So  many  trains.  The  men  and  organizations  assembled  would  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">shape that future in ways people were only beginning to imagine. Representing </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson at the event was his personal representative, Walter Jones. Jones was the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris-based manager of all European operations and a man who would one day </p>
<p class="calibre1">become chairman of IBM Canada.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Framed  by  swastikas  front  and  rear,  a  clearly  impressed  Jones  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first  to  speak.  He  proclaimed  in  German,  "It  is  an  outstanding  honor  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">privilege for me to be with you and to represent Mr. Thomas J. Watson, pres- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ident  of  International  Business  Machines,  on  the  occasion  of  the  formal </p>
<p class="calibre1">opening  of  this  magnificent  factory  .  .  .  the  new  and  permanent  home  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag."37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Repeatedly  using  Nazi  buzzwords  for  economic  recovery,  Jones  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">clear  that  Mr.  Watson  agreed  to  the  new  construction  "because  he  realized </p>
<p class="calibre1">your  organization  had  outgrown  the  facilities  .  .  .  [and]  the  time  was  propi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tious  ...  as  it  would  give  employment  to  many  idle  workmen  and  thus  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  the  unemployed."  Peppering  Watson's  name  and  imprimatur  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  address,  Jones  praised,  "the  noble  work  undertaken  by  your  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">in its aim to give work to every German citizen."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Heidinger  came  to  the  front,  nattily  dressed  with  a  small  hand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">kerchief  peeking  from  his  suit  jacket  pocket,  the  man  was  clearly  emotional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  feel  it  almost  a  sacred  action,  if  in  this  hour  I  consecrate  this  place  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  mother  earth,"  he  began.  Reviewing  Dehomag's  turbulent  history,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">described  how  the  tiny  company  had  persevered  despite  a  lack  of  financing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Great War, and the suffocating post-War inflation.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  at  that  very  time,  Heidinger  was  battling  Watson  over  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">appointment  of  Hummel,  in  this  moment  of  Nazi  fulfillment,  Heidinger  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">effusive.  Recalling  IBM's  acquisition  of  Dehomag,  he  recast  the  story  not  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  acrimonious  takeover  but  as  a  financial  rescue  by  a  benevolent  friend  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  German  people.  "I  express  our  deepest  appreciation  and  our  thanks  for, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  noblesse  not  to  be  surpassed,  proved  by  our  creditor  .  .  .  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  Machines  Corporation  under  the  management  of  their  president, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas  J.  Watson,  in  our  condition  of  distress....  [IBM]  could  have  been  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  position  to  take  over  our  entire  firm  by  .  .  .  enforcing  their  claim  for  bank- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ruptcy ... but [instead] purchased a share in our company."40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continually invoking Nazi re employment cliches, Heidinger promised </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Dehomag would provide "bread and work" for German citizens. In that </p>
<p class="calibre1">vein, he said that IBM had calculated the cost of a grand opening banquet </p>
<p class="calibre1">and instead would contribute the 10,000 Reichsmarks to the Winter Subsidy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a Nazi program donating funds and food to those thrown into deeper job- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lessness by the international anti-Nazi boycott.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He concluded by unveiling a building plaque commemorating the fac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tory both to "the national awakening of the German people" and to its </p>
<p class="calibre1">future. Heidinger concluded by asking that "the blessing of heaven may rest </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon this place."42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Final remarks were offered by Schmeer on behalf of the powerful Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man Labor Front. "German men, German women," he proclaimed, "the fact </p>
<p class="calibre1">that we are on the way up under Hitler's leadership despite the present condi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions was doubted by many, not just by our enemies, but also by people who </p>
<p class="calibre1">were willing to work honestly and diligently. The opening of this factory . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">shows that the road Hitler has prescribed and which he took last year was </p>
<p class="calibre1">right, namely to bring trust into the German economy. People in the past were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not lacking commitment to hard work but they lacked trust . . . the Volks </p>
<p class="calibre1">community now present in this factory is here to stay, and stay for all eter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nity... It will produce goods, which will help our people in their ascent."43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snapping into respect, Schmeer pumped his arm forward exclaiming, "I </p>
<p class="calibre1">now ask you to collect our joy and cry out: 'Our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, Sieg </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heil!'" The crowd reciprocated with fire: Sieg Heil! The choir burst into the </p>
<p class="calibre1">national anthem, "Deutschland uber Alles."44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marching  out  enthusiastic  and  reassured,  swept  into  the  moment,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">regaled Brown Shirts chanted the "Horst Wessel Song."45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon Hitler's flags will wave </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over every single street </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enslavement ends </p>
<p class="calibre1">When soon we set things right! </p>
<p class="calibre1">For IBM and Dehomag both, it was an extraordinary day of Nazi com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">munion. Two days later, Jones sent off verbatim translations of the speeches </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Watson with an enthusiastic cover letter declaring, "as your representative, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I attended the formal opening . . .  I have never witnessed a more interesting </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceremony." Jones attached a fist of all the Nazi figures that attended, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even made clear that the dignitaries included the SA's "Gorlitzer, who suc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceeded Dr. Goebbels in the latter's former position." Jones' letter proudly </p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned   "a full company of  Nazi storm troups [sic] with band" and </p>
<p class="calibre1">promised IBM's Leader that plenty of photos would follow.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  sent  a  personal  letter  to  Heidinger.  "Mr.  Jones  sent  me  a  copy  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  speech  you  made  at  the  opening  of  the  new  factory  in  Berlin  .  .  .  and  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  read  it  with  a  great  deal  of  interest.  ..  you  are  certainly  to  be  congratu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lated  upon  the  manner  in  which  you  conveyed  your  thoughts."  The  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  so  proud  of  the  event  that  Dehomag  printed  commemorative  programs </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  event  with  photographs  and  transcripts  of  the  speeches  made  at  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">the census complex and the factory.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  turning  back  now.  IBM  and  the  Nazi  party  had  bonded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swastikas  and  corporate  slogans  had  found  their  common  ground.  Day  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">night,  the  Jewish  names  clattered  through  IBM  systems,  faster  and  faster,  city </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  city,  profession  by  profession.  Dehomag  was  the  Third  Reich's  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  deliverer.  As  such, they  were  afforded  a  special  place  in the  mindset  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  planners.  It  was  an  awesome  responsibility  for  Dehomag  and  IBM,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">one they accepted with doctrinaire devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  feeling  was  captured  by  one  Nazi  newspaper,  Der  Deutsche,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent  a  reporter  to  cover  the  Lichterfelde  ceremonies.  The  paper  quoted  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  on  the  nature  of  the  company.  Heidinger  explained  it  this  way:  "Chil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dren's character is determined by their parents. Firms' by their founders."48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMANY WAS quietly tabulating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Hitler's  rhetoric  was  burning  the  parade  grounds  and  airwaves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  Storm  Troopers  were  marching  Jews  through  the  streets  in  ritual </p>
<p class="calibre1">humiliations,  while  Reich  legislative  decrees  and  a  miasma  of  regional  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">private  policies  were  ousting  Jews  from  their  professions  and  residences, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  noisy,  outrageous  acts  of  persecution  were  appalling  the  world,  a  qui- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eter process was also underway. Germany was automating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  systems  could  do  more  than  count.  They  could  schedule,  ana- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lyze, and compute. They could manage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several  dozen  Hollerith  systems  were  already  in  use  by  a  small  clique </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  German  industrial  firms  and  government  offices.49  But  now  Hitler's  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  that  in  its  quest  for  supremacy,  it  could  mechanize,  organize,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">control  virtually  all  aspects  of  private  and  commercial  life,  from  the  largest </p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  cartel  to  the  humblest  local  shopkeeper.  Just  as  people  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">categorized  and  regimented  down  to  the  least  characteristic,  so  would  all  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">German business be analyzed to the smallest detail—and then subject to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi discipline. The economy could recover. People could go back to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it would all he done toward a single, totally coordinated Nazi goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A global movement was loudly organizing to shatter the German econ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">omy and topple the repressive Hitler regime by denying economic recovery, </p>
<p class="calibre1">prolonging German joblessness, and boycotting German commerce. But IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">was mobilizing its financial and engineering might to do the opposite. Gen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eral Manager Rottke echoed IBM's attitude at the Lichterfelde factory open- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing, declaring, "We are able to hereby assist our government in its battle </p>
<p class="calibre1">against unemployment." Work and bread was the theme IBM and Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">used again and again to describe their venture—all in support of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">National Socialist goal. As Heidinger told his audience, "Public interest pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vails over private interest."50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  technology  had  become  a  German  administrative  way  of  life, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch  cards  would  enable  the  entire  Reich  to  go  on  a  war  footing.  For  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was a bonanza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's client list sparkled. Electrical combines such as Siemens in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin and Lech-Elektrizitatswerke in Augsburg. Heavy industry such as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannesmann in Diisseldorf and I.G. Farben in Frankfurt. Automakers such </p>
<p class="calibre1">as Opel in Russelsheim and Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart. Retail stores such as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woolworth and Hertie in Berlin. Optical manufacturers such as Zeiss in Jena </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Zeiss Ikon in Dresden. Chocolate factories such as Schokoladenfabrik in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tangermunde. Coffee producers such as Kaffee Handels A.G. in Bremen.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aircraft engines: 10 customers; coal mining: 7 customers; chemical plants: </p>
<p class="calibre1">18 customers; electrical products: 10 customers; motor vehicle industry: 11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers; shipbuilders: 2 customers; railroads, buses, trams, and other trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portation: 32 customers; insurance companies: 26 customers; banks: 6 cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">TOMERS; public utilities: 16 customers; iron and steel: 19 customers; turbines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">engines, and tractors: 7 customers.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leather  tanning,  washing  machine  manufacture,  liquor,  paint  and  var- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nishes,  cigarettes,  perfumes,  railway  car  assembly,  ball  bearings,  rubber, </p>
<p class="calibre1">petroleum, shoes, oleomargarine, asbestos, explosives.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichspost,  Reichsbahn,  Pension  Funds,  the  Luftwaffe,  the  Navy.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Payroll,  inventory  control,  material  strength  calculations,  personnel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">finance,  scheduling,  product  usage,  and  manufacturing  supervision.55  There </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  virtually  no  business  that  could  not  benefit  from  punch  card  technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  deftly  controlled  the  data  operations  of  the  entire  Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  one  Dehomag  customer  account  could  represent  dozens  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines. Hollerith systems involved an ensemble of interconnected devices </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  could  be  manufactured  in  a  variety  of  configurations.  Punchers,  proofers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">verifiers,  sorters,  tabulators,  alphabetizers,  multipliers,  printers.  I.G.  Farben </p>
<p class="calibre1">installed  arrays  in  Offenbach,  Bitterfeld,  Berlin,  Hoechst,  and  other  locations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daimler-Benz  utilized  machines  in  Berlin,  Stuttgart,  Genshagen,  and  other  sites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Junkers  employed  Hollerith  devices  in  Magdeburg,  Leopoldshall,  Kothen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dessau,  and  numerous  other  cities.  Municipalities  everywhere  used  the  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines.  Frankfurt  am  Main's  Public  Works  Department  alone  maintained  an  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tended  suite  of  punchers,  verifiers,  tabulators,  multipliers,  and  sorters.  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices—federal, regional, and local—could not lease enough systems.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gleichschaltung,  that  is,  total  central  coordination,  demanded  that  end- </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  accountings  be  submitted  regularly  to  government  bureaus,  Nazified </p>
<p class="calibre1">trade  associations,  and  statistical  agencies.  Kommissars  and  government  regu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lations  required  companies  to  install  Hollerith  machines  to  ensure  prompt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">uniform,  up-to-the-minute  reports  that  could  be  reprocessed  and  further  tab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulated.  The  Reich  Statistical  Office's  Department  I  was  officially  charged  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  responsibility  of  helping  companies  transition  to  the  elaborate  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">methodology.  Statistical  bureaus  hired  thousands  of  new  staffers  just  to  keep </p>
<p class="calibre1">up with the data flow.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  Germany  began  achieving  undreamed  of  efficiencies.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichsbahn  was  a  vital  customer  for  Dehomag,  deploying  full  or  partial  sys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tems  in  Essen,  Cologne,  Nuremberg,  Mainz,  Frankfurt,  Hannover,  and  nearly </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  other  major  connection  point.  Some  140  million  passengers  annually </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  booked  through  Dehomag  card  sorting  systems.  Punch  cards  made  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">trains  run  on  time  and  even  evaluated  engine  efficiency  when  pulling  certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">types  of  freight.  Records  in  some  railway  operations  that  previously  required </p>
<p class="calibre1">300  people  six  months  to  organize  could  now  be  computed  by  a  staff  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifteen working for just a week.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Customers  such  as  Krupp,  Siemens,  and  the  Deutsche  Bank  were  able </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  reduce  their  operating  costs  and  clerical  staffs  by  as  much  as  half,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">plow  those  human  and  financial  resources  into  sellable  goods  and  services. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manpower  could  be  shifted  as  needed  from  plant  to  plant  by  companies  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">deployed from city to city by the German Labor Front.59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  meet  fast-expanding  demand,  Dehomag  hired  more  than  1,000  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  to  staff  the  new  factory  at  Lichterfelde.  Everywhere  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  plant,  newly  installed  machine  tools  were  fabricating  Hollerith  devices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Workshops  buzzed,  cranked,  and  whirred  with  Beling  &amp;  Lubke  precision </p>
<p class="calibre1">lathes,  Jung  surface  grinders,  Boley  milling  machines,  Hille  high-speed  drills, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auerbach  &amp;  Scheibe  3-spindle  drill  presses,  Thiel  metal  saws,  Karger  thread- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cutting lathes, and Universal grinding machines.60 Metal shavings, oil cans, </p>
<p class="calibre1">iron  rods,  tin  coils,  ball  bearings,  alloy  sheets,  and  rubber  rollers  combined </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  bent  elbows,  squinting  eyes,  wedging  bands  and  brows  wiped  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeves of work smocks to create a manufacturing miracle. IBM zeal and Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">devotion coalesced to help the Reich recover and strengthen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lichterfelde was overwhelmed with orders. It established a "shock </p>
<p class="calibre1">department" for the speedy manufacture of spare parts, retrofitted an old </p>
<p class="calibre1">disused IBM plant from pre-merger days, and converted it to a workshop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside storage, some 1,200 square meters costing more than RM 12,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">annually, was rented. Workmen shutded materials back and forth from the </p>
<p class="calibre1">storage site to the overcrowded Lichterfelde site where even corridor space </p>
<p class="calibre1">was at a premium. "Our own workshops (technical) grew to such an extent," </p>
<p class="calibre1">complained Heidinger in a report to IBM NY, "that every square meter of </p>
<p class="calibre1">space was overfilling with machines and persons, and the acute shortage of </p>
<p class="calibre1">space became more and more critical."61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  explosive  growth  arose  not  only  from  a  dictatorial  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">shalling  of  all  commerce,  but  also  because  of  a  completely  new  industry </p>
<p class="calibre1">within  Nazi  Germany:  race  science.  Identifying  who  was  a  Jew—either  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">certifying  Aryan  lineage  or  exposing  Jewish  ancestry  became  big  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">overnight.  Hollerith  alone  possessed  the  technology  to  efficiendy  provide  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">answers Nazi raceologists craved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RACE SCIENCE, rooted in the international Eugenics movement, had long </p>
<p class="calibre1">been a pseudo-scientific discipline within the Nazi culture. In Germany, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">field transformed from vague debates into a lucrative reality when two fac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors converged. It began when a multiplicity of anti-Jewish decrees and pri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vate provisos demanded Jewish ousters and pure Aryan descent. But these </p>
<p class="calibre1">racist requirements clashed with what Dehomag had exposed when it com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">puled the 1933 census: not all the Jews could be identified by a mere census. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Census tabulations isolated nearly a half million Jews, less than 1 per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent of the overall German population, and 65,000 less than the previous </p>
<p class="calibre1">national census in 1925. Reich statisticians saw this drop as validation that </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the new political order had induced a strong emigration trend." But in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi mindset, the half million identified were merely the most obvious Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish layer, the so-called "practicing Jews."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  ideology  defined  Jewishness  not  as  a  function  of  religious  prac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tice,  but  bloodline.  How  far  back?  Nazi  theoreticians  debated  tracing  parent- </p>
<p class="calibre1">age.  Some  looked  at  grandparents.  Some  suggested  searching  back  four </p>
<p class="calibre1">generations.  Still  others  focused  on  the  year  1800,  before  Jewish  emancipa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion, that is, before assimilation into German society.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  statisticians  concluded  from  t h e  occupational  yi el ds  of  the  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  census  that  "there  are  quite  a  number  of  Jews  in  these  'independent </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupations'  who  have  left  the  community  of  the  Jewish  faith.  Those  'Jews' </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  be  recorded  as  Jews  in  the  1933  Census.  That  means  that  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">infiltration  into  our  cultural  life  is  probably  much  greater  than  the  numbers </p>
<p class="calibre1">for practicing Jews would otherwise indicate."64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estimates  of  how  many  ancestral  Jews,  baptized  or  not,  really  dwelled </p>
<p class="calibre1">within  the  Reich  ranged  far  above  the  traditional  600,000.  But  no  one  knew </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  how  many.  Nazi  raceologists  devised  a  bizarre  pseudo-mathematical  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mula that grouped ancestral Jews into a series of grades, such as fully Jewish, </p>
<p class="calibre1">half-Jewish,  and  quarter-Jewish,  depending  upon  how  many  Jewish  parents </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  grandparents  could  be  calculated  from  their  past.  All  of  it  defied  logic </p>
<p class="calibre1">once  one  added  other  generation-to-generation  dynamics  such  as  remar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">riages and divorces.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Logical  or  not,  everywhere  Germany  was  buzzing  with  the  need  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">trace  ancestry  by  cross-indexing  births,  deaths,  baptisms,  and  other  data </p>
<p class="calibre1">going  back  generations.  Since  racial  decrees  mandated  that  only  Aryans </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  participate  in  many  walks  of  life,  German  individuals,  companies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">schools,  associations  of  every  size  and  caliber,  and  even  churches,  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">gripped  by  the  necessity  to  prove  their  Aryan  purity  and  to  exclude  everyone </p>
<p class="calibre1">else.  Moreover,  physical  characteristics  such  as  height,  stature,  and  blond, </p>
<p class="calibre1">blue-eyed features, were all thought to be coefficients of racial descent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Linguistics  played  a  dynamic  role.  Words  such  as  public  health  and  medi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cine, nationality, foreigners, family and family genealogy, hereditary, and even </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  word  German,  took  on  special  anti-Semitic  implications.  Jews  were  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eigners, and in many cases thought to be disease carriers. Racial impurity was </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  public  health  issue.  Only  Aryans  could  be  Germans.  The  word  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">became exclusionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  competitive,  confusing,  and  often  overlapping  network  of  governmental, </p>
<p class="calibre1">private,  and  pseudo-academic  agencies  with  constandy  evolving  names,  juris- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dictions,  and  sponsors  sprang  up  into  existence.  Many  of  them  direcdy  or  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">direcdy  benefited  from  Hollerith's  high-speed  technology  to  sort  through  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">voluminous  handwritten  or  manually  typed  genealogical  records  needed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">construct definitive family trees. These machines were often housed elsewhere, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  the  Reich  Statistical  Office  departments,  which  processed  pen  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper forms into race statistics. No one shall ever know how many race track- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  agencies  accessed  which  machines  in  which  locations  during  those  first </p>
<p class="calibre1">chaotic  years.  But  this  much  is  known—the  Third  Reich  possessed  only  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">method of cross-tabulating personal information: Dehomag's Hollerith system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's complex of race science agencies ultimately look on a bureau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cratic  life  of  its  own.  The  Fuhrer's  Office  operated  the  Race  Political  Office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Justice Ministry empowered one of its lower court divisions to rule on mat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters of hereditary health. Josef Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda vested its </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department II with questions of Jewish policy, popular health, and popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. Labor and unemployment offices under the aegis of the Labor Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained an index of foreigners, meaning Jews and non-Aryans.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Race science in the Interior Ministry was the provenance of the Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Committee for the Protection of German Blood. Department I dealt with </p>
<p class="calibre1">issues of race law and policies. Department IV studied population politics, </p>
<p class="calibre1">genetic hygiene, and medical statistics. Department VI was concerned with </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign groups within Germany.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reich Health Office, also part of the Interior Ministry, included two </p>
<p class="calibre1">special units: Department L supervised genetic health and racial hygiene; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department M was authorized to oversee genetic research. In addition, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich Committee for Popular Health, which advised the Interior Ministry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained a sub-office for genetic and race hygiene.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Reich Statistical Office, which was completely dependent upon </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM equipment and technical assistance, Department IV was responsible not </p>
<p class="calibre1">only for traditional data such as census, household, and family data, but nation- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ality and race statistics as well. The Ministry of Science and Education devel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oped special offices for racial and genetic research and oversaw the work of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Genetics and Eugenics.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nazi Party itself also maintained a plethora of structured and infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mal special advisory bureaus on race and public health.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offices devoted to race science melded genuine documentation with </p>
<p class="calibre1">rumors, poison pen letters, and vengeful tips. Challenges to one's Aryan </p>
<p class="calibre1">background were commonplace. Whether driven by a sense of national duty </p>
<p class="calibre1">or ordinary fear, everyone was forced to confront their racial make-up. At the </p>
<p class="calibre1">apex of racial grading was a bureaucratic entity attached to the Interior Min- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istry. This section began its existence before 1933 as the Nazi Information </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office. Ultimately, after numerous name changes, it became known as the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichssippenamt, or Reich Family Office, endowed with the final authority to </p>
<p class="calibre1">decide who was Jewish or Aryan.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lists  were  distributed,  exchanged,  and  updated  continously,  often  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">haphazard  fashion.  To  cope  with  the  growing  bureaucratic  fascination  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch card records, senior Interior Ministry officials reviewed one fanciful pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">posal  for  a  twenty-five-floor  circular  tower  of  data  to  centralize  all  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">information. The proposal was rejected because it would take years to build </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  stork.  But  the  futuristic  concept  opened  the  eyes  of  Reich  planners.  Each </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  twenty-five  floors  in  the  imagined  tower  would  be  comprised  of  12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">circular  rooms  representing  one  birth  year.  Every  circular  room  would  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  31  cabinets,  one  for  each  day  of  the  month.  Each  cabinet  would  in  turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">contain  7,000  names.  Registrations  and  updates  would  feed  in  from  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaus.  All  60  million  Germans  could  then  be  organized  and  cross-indexed </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a single location regardless of changes in residence.  Data could  be retrieved </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  some  1,500  couriers  running  from  room  to  room  like  so  many  magnetic </p>
<p class="calibre1">impulses fetching files.72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lists  were  indeed  everywhere.  Non-German  Registries  were  maintained </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  police  stations,  employment  bureaus,  professional  associations,  church </p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations,  local  Nazi  departments,  and  the  SS  Security  Office,  the  Sicher- </p>
<p class="calibre1">heitsdienst, known as the SD. The SD was under the control of Reinhard Hey- </p>
<p class="calibre1">drich, nicknamed the Hangman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buried  within  the  bowels  of  Heydrich's  Berlin  office  was  the  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  of  Research,  which  developed  registries  on  Freemasons.  In  1934,  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  SD's  nameless  specialists  on  Freemasons  demonstrating  particular  zeal </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  corporal  who  had  just  transferred  in  from  the  Dachau  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp.  He  showed  such  promise  working  with  registries  that  he  was  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">assigned  to  Referat  II  112,  the  Jewish  Department,  where  he  could  work  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">more lists. The corporal's name was Adolf Eichmann.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  cross-indexing  capabilities  and  sorting  routines  of  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery  became  more  sophisticated,  race  researchers  continuously  discov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered  greater  informational  depth  about  Jews  and  those  of  Jewish  bloodline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Dehomag,  such  statistical  feats  were  both  its  science  and  its  competitive </p>
<p class="calibre1">edge. Educating its customers was an everyday occurrence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  August  1934  article  in  the  Dehomag  publication,  Hollerith  Nach- </p>
<p class="calibre1">richten,  extolled  the  benefits  of  advanced  data  processing.  The  article,  enti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tled  "An  Improved  Analysis  of  Statistical  Interdependencies  via  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch  Card  Process,"  illustrated  how  difficult  data  calculations  could  be  bet- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter  interpreted  and  predict  probabilities.  As  a  prime  example,  the  journal </p>
<p class="calibre1">cited  "the  field  of  medicine,  and  the  science  of  genetics  and  race."  Complex </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulations  could  be  rendered,  the  article  suggested,  regarding  "the  size  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">fathers  and  their  children,  number  of  children  and  parents.  Diphtheria  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">age,  and  the  different  racial  characteristics."  The  article  explained,  "Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">though  the  gathering  of  statistical  material  in  industrial  and  commercial  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nesses  has  steadily  grown  in  size  . . .   in  administrative  archives  and  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  censuses  and  other  surveys,  the  interpretation  has  not  kept  pace.  Due  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the lack of manpower ... one is limited . . .  to sorting out past developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  This  is  not  always  enough...  The  actual  justification  for  the  collection  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">data in great quantity is the a b i l i t y  to draw conclusions . . . and ensure a safe </p>
<p class="calibre1">estimate of future and current occurrences.'"74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Racial purity was not just a catchphrase for Nazis, it was an obsession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany wanted more than a society of Aryans, it wanted a master race: tall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">strong, blond, and blue-eyed, intellectually and physically dominant. Eugen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ics became an elite cult. Nazis sought to weed out the weaker elements of its </p>
<p class="calibre1">population,  regardless  of  parentage—even  from  among  their  own  people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mentally  ill,  diseased,  handicapped,  homosexual  individuals,  certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, Gypsies, and a group of misfits termed "anti-social," were not to be part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Germany's future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning  in  summer  1934,  the  Third  Reich  took  the  next  step.  Armed </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  statistical  data  and  other  information  collected  from  medical  offices, </p>
<p class="calibre1">doctors,  and  insurance  companies  across  the  nation,  Germany  began  orga- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nized sterilization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO DECREES were promulgated by mid-1934. One was The Law for Simpli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fication of the Health System, enacted in July 1934, requiring doctors and other </p>
<p class="calibre1">clinicians to fill out detailed forms about the health condition of their </p>
<p class="calibre1">patients. These were filed with Health Offices and eventually processed by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  systems  at  the  Reich  Statistical  Offices  in  Berlin  and  its  regional </p>
<p class="calibre1">divisions.  The  information,  combined  with  extensive  information  from  health </p>
<p class="calibre1">insurance questionnaires, created a eugenic profile.75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second decree was The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Sick </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offspring made active in January 1934. Eugenic theorists in Germany had </p>
<p class="calibre1">developed a maze of precepts mandating exactly which bloodlines should be </p>
<p class="calibre1">terminated based on the statistical probability of endowing defective genes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sterilization guidelines initially specified individuals deemed insane, retarded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">epileptic or manic-depressive, among others.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now eugenic pseudo-academicians and Nazi statisticians evolved </p>
<p class="calibre1">an additional belief that a man's right to live was determined by his net </p>
<p class="calibre1">worth to Nazi society. "The only value of man—and this is a direct object of </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics—is his economic value . . .  his human labor productivity," wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich Zahn in a 1934 edition of the German statistical journal, Allge- </p>
<p class="calibre1">meines Statistisches Archiv. Zahn's article, "The Economic Value of Man As an </p>
<p class="calibre1">Object of Statistics," reminded that, "statistics is identical in character with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the National Socialist idea."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn called for a "registration of the various risks which threaten the </p>
<p class="calibre1">value of productivity ... [as a result of] ... illnesses, disability, unemployment </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  non-accomplishment  of  occupational  goals."  Population  engineering,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasized,  would  rely  upon  extensive  data  analysis,  including  s t a t i s t i c s  </p>
<p class="calibre1">from a gamut of health bureaus, disability and liability insurers, unemployment </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices, and even academic testing data from schools.78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  genetic  experts  worried  about  not  only  those  individuals  exhibit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  undesired  traits,  but  the  parents  and/or  children  who  might  carry  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">traits  and  therefore  contaminate  the  gene  pool.  One  census  theoretician  pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tulated  that  the  potential  for  contamination  could  be  set  at  a  25  percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">chance  per  diseased  parent.  Hence,  once  an  undesirable  person  was  identi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied,  the  parents  and  offspring,  including  newborn  children,  required  steril- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ization as well.79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  the  notion  of  sterilizing  the  physically  undesirable  expanded </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  include  the  socially  undesirable.  So-called  anti-socials,  that  is,  misfits  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  to  be  unsuited  for  labor,  became  special  targets.  A  leading  raceolo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gist  described  anti-socials  as  "those  who,  based  on  their  personality,  are  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">capable  of  meeting  the  minimum  requirements  of  society,  i.e.,  personal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">social,  and  volkisch  behavior."  One  official  definition  cited:  "human  beings </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  hereditary  and  irreversible  mental  attitude,  who  .  .  .  have  repeatedly </p>
<p class="calibre1">come  into  conflict  with  government  agencies  and  the  courts,  and  thus  appear </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  a  threat  to  humanity."  Included  were  traitors,  race  violators,  sexual  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">verts,  and  "secret  Jews."  But,  "the  numerically  largest  group  consists  of  'the </p>
<p class="calibre1">work-shy and habitual parasites'"80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compulsory  sterilization  was  aimed  principally  at  those  adjudged  phys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ically  and  mentally  inferior  regardless  of  their  race  or  nationality.  However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  criteria  applied  not  only  to  general  groups  exhibiting  the  proscribed </p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics,  but,  in  the  new  lexicon  of  anti-Semitism,  to  virtually  all  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">within Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  systems  compiled  nearly  all  the  medical,  health,  and  welfare </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics  in  Germany,  either  at  the  compilation  site  or  through  the  Reich  Sta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tistical  Office.  Hollerith  Nachrichten  aggressively  proliferated  its  population- </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineering  technology  to  new  customers.  An  article  entided  "The  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch  Card  Process  in  Welfare  and  Social  Security"  boasted,  "sorting  proce- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dures  are  done  by  Hollerith  machines  with  such  speed  and  reliability  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  directors  of  the  welfare  administration  are  unrestricted  in  their  catalog  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">questions."  It  added,  "The  solution  is  that  every  interesting  feature  of  a  statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tical  nature  ...  can be  summarized  . . .   by  one  basic  factor. This  basic  factor is </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Hollerith punch card."81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Questionnaires,  although  to  be  filled  out  by  hand,  were  jointly  designed </p>
<p class="calibre1">by Dehomag engineers and Nazi disability or welfare experts for compatibil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity, since ultimately all information would be punched into Hollerith cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet, as a Dehomag notice to users advised, the questionnaires would have to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be adapted to the technical demands of the Hollerith system, not the other </p>
<p class="calibre1">way around. A vertical notice printed along the bottom left of typical welfare </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms often indicated the information was to be processed "by the punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card office" generally an in-house bureau.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  seated  in  a  doctor's  office  or  a  welfare  line  never  comprehended </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  destiny  of  routine  information  about  their  personal  traits  and  conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Question  11  required  a  handwritten  checkmark  if  the  individual  was  a  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eigner.  Later,  this  information  was  punched  into  the  correlating  punch  card  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">columns </p>
<p class="calibre1">29-30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">under </p>
<p class="calibre1">nationality.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  many  clerks  and  doctors,  coding  was  a  new  procedure.  Various </p>
<p class="calibre1">editions  of  Hollerith  Nachrichten  tutored  readers  on  the  proper  method  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">filling  out  Hollerith-compatible  forms.  In  one  issue  it  reminded  form  proces- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sots  to  code  Special  Characteristics  in  the  several  columns  field  12.  Anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">social  was  to  be  coded  1  in  one  column.  In  a  second  column,  diseases </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  blindness  were  coded  1.  Mental  disease  was  2.  Cripples  were  3.  Deaf </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  were  5.  Parents  who  had  already  been  sterilized  were  to  be  noted </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  an  "s";  children  already  sterilized  "because  of  a  parent's  sickness"  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">noted "as".84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uniform  codes  were  established  for  occupations.  Factory  workers  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">coded  19,  hotel  and  guesthouse  workers  were  23,  theatre  artisans  were  26. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unemployed  persons  received  the  code  number  28.  These  codes  were  hand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">written into field 8 on the forms.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Diseases  were  also  coded:  influenza  was  3,  lupus  was  7,  syphilis  was  9, </p>
<p class="calibre1">diabetes was 15; they were entered into field 9.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once coded and punched, all data was then sorted by machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If agencies lacked the manpower to undertake their registrations, or the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money to buy the equipment, Dehomag would perform the work for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Insurers, for example, could send quarterly data directly to the Lichterfelde </p>
<p class="calibre1">office for processing. Volume was important. "Since the work is done by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag," advertised a company solicitation, the approach was recom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mended for any insurance company carrying "more than 15,000 members."87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Graphs, organizational charts, and work flow diagrams published by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag bolstered the modern technological feat of its data processing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One work flow diagram showed the complex method by which handwritten </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms and questionnaires in any agency's master personnel file were mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">shaled through a dozen separate sorting, proofing, resorting, and tabulating </p>
<p class="calibre1">stages until results were finalized.88 An individual looking at a plain paper </p>
<p class="calibre1">form  filled  out  by  pen  or  pencil  might  never  comprehend  the  tortuous  route </p>
<p class="calibre1">that document would take through the Hollerith process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  most  aggressive  locales  implementing  Hollerith  technology </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  race  science  was  the  city  of  Hamburg.  Doctors  there  submitted  extensive </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  on  all  their  patients  to  a  Central  Health  Passport  Archive  where  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  could  be  retrieved  when  needed  and  exchanged  with  other  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istries.  Archive  officials  asked  for  reciprocal  exchanges  with  "health  and  wel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fare  institutions  of  all  kinds,  economic  welfare,  youth  and  education  welfare, </p>
<p class="calibre1">court  decisions,  special  foster  care,  sterilizations  .  .  .  and  all  other  sentences </p>
<p class="calibre1">where personality evaluations are considered."89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raceology  was  enabled  as  never  before.  Statistician  Zahn  extolled  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">fact  that  "registered  persons  can  be  observed  continually,  [through]  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  of  statistical  central  offices  .  .  .  [so]  other  statistical  population </p>
<p class="calibre1">matters  can  be  settled  and  regulated."  Zahn  proposed  "a  single  file  for  [the] </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  population  to  make  possible  an  ethnic  biological  diagnosis  [to]  turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">today's  theory  into  tomorrow's  practice.  Such  a  file  would  serve  both  prac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tical  considerations  as  well  as  science,"  he  argued,  adding,  "Clarified  pictures </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  volume  of  genetic  diseases  within  the  population  ...  now  gives  science </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  new  impetus  to  conduct  research  .  .  .  which  should  promote  good  instead </p>
<p class="calibre1">of bad genetic stock."90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genetic  denunciations  and  routine  evaluations  were  adjudicated  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genetic  Health  Courts  based  on  a  combination  of  anecdotal  evidence  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  data.  The  accused  included  parents  guilty  of  no  more  than  the  mis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fortune  of  a  birth-defected  child,  innocent  newborns  of  the  statistically  sus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pect,  helpless  individuals  condemned  as  depressed  or  psychiatric  within  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">world gone mad, and those who just didn't fit into the new Nazi milieu.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  sterilization  program's  first  year,  1934,  more  than  84,600  cases </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought  to  the  Genetic  Health  Courts  resulted  in  62,400  forced  steriliza- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions. In 1935, 88,100 genetic trials yielded 71,700 forced sterilizations.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  sterilization  was  viewed  as  merely  preliminary  to  more  dras- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tic  measures  for  cleansing  the  Reich.  Zahn  warned  in  a  statistical  journal  arti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cle:  "population  politics,  according  to  the  principles  of  racial  hygiene,  must </p>
<p class="calibre1">promote  valuable  genetic  stock,  prevent  the  fertility  of  inferior  life,  and  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware  of  genetic  degeneration.  In  other  words,  this  means  superior  life  selec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  eradication  of  genetically  unwanted  stock  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  other  hand.  The  ethnic  biological  diagnosis  is  indispensable  to  carry  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">this task."93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">W H E N   H E R M A N  HOLLERITH designed his first  punch card, he made it the size </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  a    dollar  bill.94  For  IBM,  information  was  money.  The  more  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">calculated,  tabulated,  sorted,  and  analyzed,  the  greater  the  demand  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.  Equally  important,  once  a  machine  was  leased,  it  required  vast </p>
<p class="calibre1">quantities of punch cards. In  many cases, a single tabulation required thousands </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  cards.  Each  card  was  designed  to  be  used  only  once,  and  in  a  single </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation.  When  Dehomag  devised  more  in-depth  data  processing,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">improvements only bolstered   card   demand.   How  many  punch  cards   were   </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed? Millions - per week.95  </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch  cards  sped  through  the  huffing  machines  of  the  Third  Reich  like  tiny </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-speed  mechanized  breaths  rapidly  inhaled  and  exhaled  one  time  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  time  only.  But  Hollerith  systems  were  delicate,  precision-engineering </p>
<p class="calibre1">instruments  that  depended  on  a  precision-engineered  punch  card  manufac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tured  to  exacting  specifications  under  ideal  conditions.  Because  electrical </p>
<p class="calibre1">current  in  the  machines  sensed  the  rectangular  holes,  even  a  microscopic </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperfection  would  make  the  card  inoperable  and  could  foul  up  the  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tire works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So IBM production specifications were rigorous. Coniferous chemical </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulp was milled, treated, and cured to create paper stock containing no </p>
<p class="calibre1">more than 5 percent ash, and devoid of ground wood, calk fibers, process- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing chemicals, slime carbon, or other impurities that might conduct electric- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity and "therefore cause incorrect machine sensing." Residues, even in trace </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts, would accumulate on gears and other mechanisms, eventually </p>
<p class="calibre1">causing jams and system shutdowns. Electrical testing to isolate defective </p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets was mandatory. Paper, when cut, had to lie flat without curl or wrin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">kle, and feature a hard, smooth finish on either side that yielded a "good </p>
<p class="calibre1">snap or rattle."96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tolerances necessitated laboratory-like mill conditions. Paper thickness: </p>
<p class="calibre1">.0067 inches plus or minus only a microscopic .0005 inch. Width: 3.25 inches </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a variance of plus .007 inches or minus .003 inches. Two basic lengths </p>
<p class="calibre1">were produced: 5.265 inches and 7.375 inches, plus or minus only .005 inch </p>
<p class="calibre1">in either case. Edges were to be cut at true right angles, corners at perfect </p>
<p class="calibre1">60 degree angles, with a quarter-inch along the top and three-eighths along </p>
<p class="calibre1">the side, all free from blade creases with the paper grain running the length </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the card. Relative humidity of 50 percent and a temperature of 70-75 de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">grees Fahrenheit was required at all times, including transport and storage.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Printing of the customer's name and specific project name was to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">legible but not excessively inked and in no circumstances sufficient to dent </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  card  or  nudge  it  out  of  its  plane,  which  could  microscopically  alter  thick- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness.  Text  or  numbers  had  to  be  printed  in  precise  positions  to  line  up  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">punching  devices  and  machine  gauges.  IBM  instructions  to  mills  declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"These  specifications  are  absolutely  necessary"  and  any  variation  "could  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tort the result."98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  IBM  could  make  and  sell  the  unique  punch  cards  for  its  machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  punch  cards  were  the  precious  currency  of  data  processing.  Depend- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  upon  the  market,  IBM  derived  as  much  as  a  third  of  its  profit  from  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales.  Overseas  sales  were  even  more  of  a  profit  center.  Punch  card  profits </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  enough  to  justify  years  of  federal  anti-trust  litigation  designed  to  break </p>
<p class="calibre1">the company's virtual monopoly on their sale and manufacture." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Herman  Hollerith  invented  his  technology  at  the  close  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">previous  century,  he  understood  the  enduring  commercial  tactic  of  prolifer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ating  a  single  universal  system  of  hardware  and  ensuring  that  he  alone  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  the  sole  compatible  soft  goods.  Hollerith  was  right  to  size  his  card  like </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  dollar.  IBM's  punch  card  monopoly  was  nothing  less  than  a  license  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">print money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Third  Reich's  first  years,  Germany  was  completely  dependent </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  IBM  NY  for  its  punch  cards.  Even  after  the  factory  in  Lichterfelde </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened,  German  manufactured  machines  were  useless  without  cards  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ported  from  the  United  States.  Card  presses  would  eventually  be  built  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  but  until  that  time,  Dehomag  was  constantly  scrambling  to  import </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  millions  of  cards  ordered  each  week  by  its  customers.  To  guard  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden  shortages,  Lichterfelde  needed  a  six-month  supply—enough  to  fill </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty-five  railroad  cars.  Half  the  stock  was  stored  off-site  in  leased  ware- </p>
<p class="calibre1">houses, and the rest in the factory.100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  vital  was  the  production  of  paper  products  that  in  May  1934  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  sought  to  regulate  mills.  An  Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry  decree  placed  an  eighteen-month  moratorium  on  establishing,  clos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing,  or  expanding  paper  mills  without  the  specific  permission  of  the  Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  hoped  to  have  its  card  presses  in  operation  before  the  moratorium </p>
<p class="calibre1">expired.101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  making  so  much  profit  in  Germany,  it  was  causing  problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  $1  million  profit  was  suddenly  earned  by  the  end  of  1933,  this  at  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  when  nearly  all  of  German  industry  was  being  battered  due  to  the  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  anti-Nazi  boycott.  Dehomag  had  sold  an  unprecedented  237  percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  its  1933  quota—outpacing  all  IBM  foreign  operations  combined.  Yet  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  precepts  denounced  large  corporate  profits,  especially  those  earned </p>
<p class="calibre1">by foreign corporations. No wonder a nervous IBM auditor in Europe con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceded to IBM NY, "Dehomag is in an  extremely dangerous position, not only </p>
<p class="calibre1">with respect to taxation, but it may be cited as a sort of monopolistic profi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teer and, where primarily owned by foreigners, it may be seriously damaged </p>
<p class="calibre1">by </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfriendly </p>
<p class="calibre1">publicity."102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Heidinger,  IBM  profits  were  good  news.  His  personal  bonus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressed  as a  stock  dividend,  would  total  nearly  a  half  million  Reichsmarks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  wanted  his  share.  But  Watson  was  not  so  inclined.  Reich  currency  regula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions sequestered profits into frozen bank accounts disbursable only within </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany. Heidinger could be paid, but not Watson. Moreover, newly en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">acted decrees taxed profit dividends harshly. If Watson couldn't receive his </p>
<p class="calibre1">money, he saw no reason why anyone else should either. As the chief stock- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holder, Watson voted that no dividends would be paid.103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  would  not  abide  Watson  first  usurping  Dehomag  and  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">usurping his share of the profits. Dehomag's extraordinary growth was an </p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment  Heidinger  had  personally  sculpted  by  virtue  of  his  Nazi  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nections. He wanted the financial reward he felt he deserved. The war for </p>
<p class="calibre1">control </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">money </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">only </p>
<p class="calibre1">escalated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conflict  arose  in  1933  as  soon  as  IBM  announced  the  merger  of  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">existing  German  subsidiaries,  the  million-dollar  expansion,  and  new  factory </p>
<p class="calibre1">construction.  Since  Heidinger  owned  a  token  share  of  one  of  the  old  minor </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies  being  folded  into  the  new  larger  Dehomag,  he  expected  his  stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  purchased  as  part  of  the  consolidation.  Watson  refused,  even  though </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">buyout </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounted </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">only </p>
<p class="calibre1">RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">2,000, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or </p>
<p class="calibre1">about </p>
<p class="calibre1">$500.104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September 25,   1933, IBM's European Manager, Walter Jones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">placed  the  question  squarely  with  Watson  personally.  Heidinger,  reported </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jones, "now thinks IBM should take this [RM 2,000] off his hands and asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  matter  be  submitted  to  you."  A  New  York  auditor  acknowledged  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  behalf  that  IBM  did  in  fact  need  Heidinger's  shares  to  effect  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">merger.  But  the  auditor  added,  since  "the  stock  at  the  moment  is  worthless </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  [because  it  has]  lost  its  entire  capital  through  its  operations  ...  we  do  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">think  it  would  be  fair  for  IBM  to  pay  him  anything  for  it."105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  knew  his  stock  had  become  worthless  only  by  virtue  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">losses </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineered </p>
<p class="calibre1">by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid </p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  fought  back.  He  went  direcdy  to  the  Reich  tax  authorities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">briefed  them  on  IBM's  entire  complex  merger  plans,  and  asked  for  a  formal </p>
<p class="calibre1">ruling  on  the  company's  tax  avoidance  strategy.  If  Heidinger  couldn't  get  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">$500, it would be cosdy for the parent company. Quickly,  IBM learned it was </p>
<p class="calibre1">very expensive to fight the feisty Heidinger.106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tax officials proposed an assessment as high as a half million dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Protracted  negotiations  ensued  w i t h   the  t a x   boards.  Screams  of  letters  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">cables  crisscrossed  the  Atlantic.  Numbers,  from  the  ferocious  to  the  moder- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ate,  bandied  between  IBM  offices.  Heidinger  had  positioned  himself  to  "save </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  day"  by  negotiating  the  taxes  down  to  a  quarter  of  their  proposed  assess- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  New  York  began  to  comprehend  the  process.  IBM  auditor  Connolly  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  point  understated  the  predicament:  "I  should  not  be  surprised  if  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Heidinger]  set  up  scares  [with  government  officials]  and  talked  them  off  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the sound of it."107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Financial  battling  between  Berlin  and  New  York  seemed  endless.  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  continuously  tried  to  extract  bits  of  compensation  and  sometimes </p>
<p class="calibre1">trivial  sums  of  expense  money.  IBM  would  block  him  through  its  controllers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers,  and  attorneys.  Heidinger  would  then  retaliate  by  aggressively </p>
<p class="calibre1">"consulting"  Reich  bureaucrats,  which  invariably  led  to  added  costs.  Con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nolly  openly  asked  in  one  letter  if  Dehomag  could  just  pursue  its  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  without  Heidinger  "running  to  the  German  government  every  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">for approval."108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  conflict  came  to  a  head  at  the  June  10,  1934,  Dehomag  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting.  Heidinger  wanted  IBM  NY  to  pay  his  dividend  taxes  resulting  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  merger.  He  also  resented  the  highly  detailed  financial  reports  required </p>
<p class="calibre1">each  month  by  IBM  auditors.  Watson  refused  to  pay  Heidinger's  dividend </p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes  and  his  auditors  would  not  relent  on  their  micromanaging  oversight.  At </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  board  meeting,  Heidinger  angrily  threatened  that  if  his  view  did  not  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vail,  than  Dehomag  was  no  longer  an  independent  German  company,  but  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign-dominated  firm.  As  such,  he  would  notify  authorities  in  Berlin.  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  would  then  be  assessed  an  extra  quarter-million  in  special  taxes  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">"prohibited  from  using  .  .  .  the  word  Deutsche"  in  its  name,  since  that  term </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  reserved  for  Aryan  businesses.  Without  the  word  Deutsche  in  Dehomag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  warned,  government  and  commercial  contracts  would  be  lost.  Minutes  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  June  10  exchange  were  omitted  from  the  meeting's  written  record. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Details, however, were summarized in a separate letter to New York.109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  when  it  came  time  to  making  capital  investments,  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">took  a  completely  opposite  approach.  In  a  memo  asking  IBM  NY  to  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  an  expensive  expansion  of  facilities,  Heidinger  asserted,  "The  manage- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  can  merely  submit  proposals;  the  decision  as  to  whether  something </p>
<p class="calibre1">should be done about it, is the responsibility of the owners."110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  IBM  and  Heidinger  forged  one  batde-scarred  compromise </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  another,  howsoever  transient.  But  no  matter  how  insolent  or  disruptive </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  became,  Watson  refused  to  disengage  from  Dehomag's  lucrative </p>
<p class="calibre1">partnership with Nazi Germany. In fact, Watson was determined to deploy as </p>
<p class="calibre1">many lawyers, accountants, and managers as necessary — and personally visit </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin as often  as  required—to make sure IBM  received all the profit— </p>
<p class="calibre1">frozen  or  not.  The  fight  with  Dehomag  would  continue—not  to  reign  in  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">technologic  alliance  with  the  Third  Reich,  but  rather  to  ensure  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">profits continued and remained unshared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WATSON KNEW he needed to stay close to developments in Germany. In </p>
<p class="calibre1">1934, he visited twice. The first was a brief stay in late June to oversee </p>
<p class="calibre1">the final merger of four IBM subsidiaries into the new larger Dehomag, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction long delayed by negotiations with the tax authorities. In addi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion, a new management and stock participation contract was needed for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger. Watson wanted to be on hand if any last-minute disputes arose </p>
<p class="calibre1">with Heidinger.111 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Watson visited Berlin that June, the Reich's forced sterilization </p>
<p class="calibre1">program was just ramping up. Everywhere, Jewish misery was evident. Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown Shirts noisily blocked the doorways of Jewish-owned shops. Unem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ployed Jews were moving out of their homes. Signs declaring Jews "not </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted" were prominently posted outside stores and cafes. But Watson did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not focus on the Nazi war against the Jews and other non-Aryans. He was </p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned with IBM's market victories in Germany and his war against any </p>
<p class="calibre1">potential competition. IBM's only possible rival was Powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag didn't own the entire German market for punch cards—only </p>
<p class="calibre1">95 percent of it. Since the first days of Herman Hollerith's census contracts at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the start of the twentieth century, IBM and its predecessor companies had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been dog-fighting the Powers Accounting Machine Company in the United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States and indeed anywhere in the world Powers tried to do business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James  Powers  was  a  Russian  immigrant  to  America  who  had  helped  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Census  Bureau  break  free  of  Hollerith's  monopoly  in  1905  by  develop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  a  similar  card  sorter.  As  such,  Powers  and  the  Hollerith  companies  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly  jousted  and  litigated  on  patent  rights.  In    1914,  while  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">criminial conviction for anti-trust was in appeal, a financially battered Powers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anxious  to  avoid  further  confrontations,  simply  asked  Watson's  CTR  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">license  its  punch  card  technology.  Without  that  license,  Powers  declared  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  go  out  of  business.  Under  the  specter  of  federal  charges,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">ostentatiously  agreed  to  license  his  competitor,  Powers,  but  at  an  exorbitant </p>
<p class="calibre1">25  percent  royalty.  This  would  ensure  that  Powers  would  survive  as  a  minis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cule  player  in  the  punch  card  field,  thus  obviating  federal  charges  of  total </p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly. But the 25 percent royalty also meant that Powers' machines were </p>
<p class="calibre1">more expensive for customers and therefore profoundly less competitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, IBM would receive a good share of all  of Powers'  revenues.112 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  government  dropped  its  anti-trust  case  against  Watson,  he  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">less inclined to let Powers survive. Recalling a tactic from his NCR days, Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  litigated  against  Powers  extensively  for  various  forms  of  patent  infringe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  raided  its  key  managers  in  America  and  abroad,  and  systematically </p>
<p class="calibre1">pressured clients to switch to Hollerith systems.113 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Germany,  Powers  did  enjoy  some  minor  installations  dating  back  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  1920s  primarily  because  it  sold  rather  than  leased  its  machines  and  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">developed  some  highly  specialized  models.  What's  more,  some  machines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  though  old,  were  simply  still  functioning.  Some  was  too  many  for  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son.  Dehomag  continued  the  IBM  legacy  of  litigation  by  suing  Powers  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  But  this  time,  it  was  not  for  patent  infringement.  It  was  for  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">being sufficiendy Aryan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  highly  charged  Nazi  business  environment,  where  certain  words </p>
<p class="calibre1">possessed  special  meaning,  Powers  was  one  of  many  firms  that  rushed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">declare  themselves  "under  German  management."  But  in  reality,  charged </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  in  the  court  complaint,  two  Americans  were  managing  the  Powers </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm.  Even  after  the  Powers  board  of  directors  ousted  its  two  American  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agers,  Heidinger  claimed  that  the  foreigners  were  nonetheless  secredy  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trolling  the  company.  All  this,  he  argued,  was  designed  by  Powers  "to </p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitate  marketing  for  its  products"  within  the  Third  Reich,  thereby  compet- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  unfairly  with  Dehomag  through  false  advertising.  Dehomag,  on  the  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,  was  pure  German  and  free  from  foreign  influence,  the  complaint </p>
<p class="calibre1">attested.114 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  late  April  1934,  the  court  agreed  and  permanendy  enjoined  Powers </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  representing  that  it  was  "German."  Punishment  for  infractions,  the  court </p>
<p class="calibre1">ruled,  would  be  an  unlimited  fine  or  imprisonment  up  to  six  months  for  each </p>
<p class="calibre1">infraction.115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  specifically  authorized  the  Powers  suit  and  been  kept  up  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">date  on  its  developments.  What's  more,  Watson  wanted  to  identify  Powers' </p>
<p class="calibre1">clients  and  convert  them  to  IBM  equipment.  Dehomag  salesmen  kept  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tailed  intelligence  on  all  Powers  customers.  Upon  request  of  the  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">office,  Lichterfelde  was  able  to  produce  a  list  of  every  Powers  customer,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect  columnar  fashion,  listing  the  year  the  client  purchased  Powers  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  which  units  were  rented  or  purchased,  the  machine's  application,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  Dehomag  sales  office  was  nearby.  That  list  was  regurgitated  alphabeti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cally, chronologically, and geographically.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The uses for a finely tuned Hollerith surveillance system were unlim- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ited. Germany never lost sight  of i t s  most  important objective: the war </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  the  Jewish  people  and    other  undesirables.    In  that  war,  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  undertake  a  steep,  years-long  technologic  climb  as  IBM  systems </p>
<p class="calibre1">improved,  Nazi  registration  campaigns  multiplied,  and  the  net  tightened.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Reich was just beginning to apply Dehomag solutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of 1934, medical, welfare, and insurance offices were joined </p>
<p class="calibre1">in their punch card registrations by nursing homes and sanitariums as well as </p>
<p class="calibre1">an ever-increasing number of German healthcare practitioners. A Registry of </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-social persons was launched. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, inaugu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rated the SS Statistical Yearbook. And "continuing education" courses in racial </p>
<p class="calibre1">hygiene conducted by noted statisticians became widely advertised.117 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition, preparations were finalizing for a national  Work Book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Employers were to fill out a booklet for each employee and then submit it to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the appropriate Labor Office. Eventually, 354 such Labor Offices would be </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened across Germany. While the Work Book was overtly a means of identi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fying and regimenting every worker in the Third Reich, a data field near the </p>
<p class="calibre1">top right asked whether, under the current Nazified definitions, the worker </p>
<p class="calibre1">was a "foreigner or stateless." Work Books, tabulated by punch card, would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become the basis for ever-increasing population scrutiny. Jews, of course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were not permitted to work. When they were discovered, they were termi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated. He who did not work would starve. Eventually, without a Work Book, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews could not obtain ration cards to purchase food.118 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  card  by  card,  sort  by  sort,  those  of  any  Jewish  blood  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be weeded out from every corner of German society no matter how they </p>
<p class="calibre1">tried to hide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1934, statistician Karl Keller expostulated the popular expectation </p>
<p class="calibre1">that gealogical tracing technology would eventually discover all the Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing in Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv, Keller assured, "The determination </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jewish descent will not be difficult because membership in the Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">faith and membership in the Jewish culture were nearly identical before the </p>
<p class="calibre1">emancipation of the Jews. It is therefore sufficient to check the change of de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nominations in church registers and registry offices for the last 130 years."119 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical sweeps with the help of Hollerith technology were already </p>
<p class="calibre1">canvassing baptism records, birth and death registries, and other church </p>
<p class="calibre1">records, not only to certify Aryanism, but also to isolate Judaism. Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers included such bodies as the Catholic Burial Society in Munich </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Church Council in Eisenach. Some church groups processed infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation on their own equipment, some merely reported their data to other </p>
<p class="calibre1">monitoring agencies. Eventually, the Non-Germanic Family Baptismal Reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istry, compiled by evangelical bodies, would list thousands of names of Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  others  who  had  converted  to  Christianity  during  the  previous  century.120 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding  it  possessed  the  technology  to  scrutinize  an  entire  nation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  proudly  advertised  its  systems  with  a  certain  unmistakable  flair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company  created  two  surrealistic  promotional  posters.  One  was  a  giant </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  hovering  over  a  factory  beaming  its  X-ray-like  searchlights  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  room  of  every  floor.  The caption  read: "Hollerith illuminates  your com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany,  provides  surveillance  and  helps  organize."  A  second  poster  depicted  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">giant  odious  eye  floating  in  the  sky  projecting  a  punch  card  over  everything </p>
<p class="calibre1">below. The caption read: "See everything with Hollerith punch cards."121 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  would  escape.  This  was  something  new  for  mankind.  Never </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  had  so  many  people  been  identified  so  precisely,  so  silently,  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly, and with such far-reaching consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dawn  of  the  Information  Age  began  at  the  sunset  of  human </p>
<p class="calibre1">decency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5 A  NAZI  MEDAL  FOR  WATSON </p>
<p class="calibre1">THOUSANDS    OF    SWASTIKA    FLAGS    FLAPPED    TEN-ABREAST </p>
<p class="calibre1">across long marching columns of Sturm Abteilung goose-stepping </p>
<p class="calibre1">under a warm Nuremberg sun. Chevroned glockenspiel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers and drummers festively tapped martial rhythms beneath tas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">seled regimental standards that wagged astride 100,000 rippling </p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders of National Socialism. Dressed in paramilitary garb, a le- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gion of stern-eyed conscripted laborers, each bearing a long shovel </p>
<p class="calibre1">slung across their collarbone like a rifle, tramped along boulevards </p>
<p class="calibre1">bannered with fifty-foot swastika bunting. A throng of 56,000 jack- </p>
<p class="calibre1">booted  disciples  sprawled  the  length  of  a  vast  field  until  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">image vanished into the distance. September 15, 1935, was Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">Day,  a  momentous  climax  to  a  week  of  choreographed  Nazi  demon- </p>
<p class="calibre1">strations. It was epic.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over </p>
<p class="calibre1">cobble-stoned </p>
<p class="calibre1">streets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">paved </p>
<p class="calibre1">market </p>
<p class="calibre1">squares, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tar-topped </p>
<p class="calibre1">avenues, and embedded trolley tracks, the stage-managed multi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tudes  flowed  in  testament  to  Fuhrer  worship.  As  rectangular  human </p>
<p class="calibre1">masses passed reviewing points, officials of the NSDAP and German </p>
<p class="calibre1">government  stood  at  attention  and  pumped  their  arms  stiff,  palms </p>
<p class="calibre1">outstretched. Everywhere the rallying call trumpeted: "Sieg." Every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where the crowd answered: "Heil!Sieg... Heil!Sieg... Heil!"2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuremberg was kinetic with cordons of artillery and air de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fense guns, light tanks, and horse cavalry brigades lumbering </p>
<p class="calibre1">beside  armies  of  uniformed  men.  Warplanes  roared  above  in  acrobatic  fly- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bys.  Then  they  theatrically  bombed  and  burned  a  sham  village  constructed </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  a  field.  Hundreds  of  miles  away,  German  U-boats  suddenly  emerged  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath  the  waves  to  conduct  naval  maneuvers  coordinated  with  the  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">land-air shows of military might.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Third  Reich  was  at  war—even  if  the  invasions  had  not  yet  begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  would  come.  For  now,  Germany  wanted  the  world  to  know  that  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  for  territorial  defense  and  conquest.  The  world  understood  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">recoiled.  All  of  Germany's  illicit  rearmament  was  in  flagrant  violation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Treaty  of  Versailles,  which  after  the  Great  War  guaranteed  a  demilitarized </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  republic.  Front-page  headlines  and  worried  diplomatic  dispatches </p>
<p class="calibre1">openly  wondered  when  a  hot  new  conflict  would  erupt.  International  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  agitation—boycotts  and  energetic  protest  gatherings—demanded  civi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lized  nations  break  Germany's  economic  back  to  deter  her  from  aggression </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Jewish persecution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  even  if  Germany's  territorial  war  had  not  yet  begun,  its  battle </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  Jewish  existence  was  raging.  So  despite  the  military  marching  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">ostentatious  weaponry,  this  day,  September  15,  1935,  would  be  dominated </p>
<p class="calibre1">not by border threats, but by Nazism's anti-Semitic frenzy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  1933,  the  Reich  had  legislated  Jewish  dislocation  from  virtually </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  facet  of  German  professional,  commercial,  and  social  life.  Many  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were so thoroughly excluded by Aryan mandates, they were reduced to buying </p>
<p class="calibre1">and selling mainly to each other just to survive. Pauperization of German Jewry </p>
<p class="calibre1">was a real threat and malnutrition of Jewish children was already attracting the </p>
<p class="calibre1">attention  of  international  aid  agencies.  Yet  many  Jews  still clung  to their rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive  anonymity.  In  businesses  owned  or  controlled  by  Jews,  or  where  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">participation  was  essential,  Jews  felt  they  could  continue  unidentified,  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed, unmolested.4 If they could just stand in, they would not stand out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  theorists  continued  to  bicker  over  what  amount  of  Judaic  parentage </p>
<p class="calibre1">constituted  an  excludable  Jew,  and  how  far  to  trace  bloodline.  Determining </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aryan pedigree was complicated by endless demographic and geographic vari- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ables  that  simply  slipped  through  the  punch  cards.  Cagey  replies  to  question- </p>
<p class="calibre1">naires  from  individuals  or  companies  nervous  about  their  answers,  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">changing  residential  and  business  addresses,  undermined  the  process.  More- </p>
<p class="calibre1">over,  suspect  citizens  rushed  to  baptismal  fonts  and  church  pews  to  assume </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  or  more  pronounced  Christian  personas.  In  consequence,  tens  of  thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands of racial purity examinations had been convened since 1933.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laxity  and  ambiguity  helped.  About  a  third  of  Germany's  nearly  450,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining registered Jews dwelled in Germany's smaller cities and towns </p>
<p class="calibre1">where in many instances they continued to exist unmolested. Many local and </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  government  agencies  often  found  it  easier  to  continue  trading  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">reliable  Jewish  firms  than  locate  an  untested  alternative.  Hausfraus  managing </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  tight  budget  commonly  sneaked  away  to  Jewish  retailers  seeking  discounts </p>
<p class="calibre1">after their dogmatic husbands went off to work.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctrinaire Nazis fought back. Night classes for housewives instructed </p>
<p class="calibre1">women how and why to avoid Jewish shops. A court ruled that husbands </p>
<p class="calibre1">were not legally bound to pay for purchases their wives made at Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">stores.  The  mayor  of  Baden  was  fired  when  his  dealings  with  Jews  were  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">covered. Jew-baiters such as Julius Streicher published rabid, pornographic </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspaper accounts of ritual murder and rampant sexual perversion by Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then cajoled and humiliated all loyal Germans into boycotting Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprises. Brown Shirts blocked the doors of Jewish establishments and </p>
<p class="calibre1">graffittied their exteriors. But too many Germans simply would not or could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not comply with the complex confusing strictures to not buy from Jews. Most </p>
<p class="calibre1">importantly, too many simply did not know where all the Jews were.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the absence of an explicit law defining exactly who in Germany was a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew, Nazi persecution was far from hermetic. For years, such a definition </p>
<p class="calibre1">would have been a cloudy exercise. Even if Nazis could agree on such an </p>
<p class="calibre1">exegesis, no one could back up the definition with hard data. Since the </p>
<p class="calibre1">advent of the Third Reich, thousands of Jews nervously assumed they could </p>
<p class="calibre1">hide from the Aryan clause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Jews  could not hide from millions of punch cards thudding </p>
<p class="calibre1">through Hollerith machines, comparing names across generations, address </p>
<p class="calibre1">changes across regions, family trees and personal data across unending reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istries. It did not matter that the required forms or questionnaires were filled </p>
<p class="calibre1">in by leaking pens and barely sharpened pencils, only that they were later </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulated and sorted by IBM's precision technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  as  Hitler's  fanatic  followers  thunder-marched  through  Nurem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">berg,  Hollerith  machines  in  Berlin  were  dispassionately  clicking  and  rattling </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  stacks  of  punch  cards  slapping  into  hoppers  to  identify  the  enemy </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the next drastic measures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  1935,  race  specialists,  bolstered  by  population  computa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  and  endless  tabular  printouts,  proffered  their  favorite  definitions  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewishness.  Some  theorems  were  so  sweeping  as  to  include  even  the  faintest </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  ancestry.  But  most  tried  to  create  pseudo-scientific  castes  limited  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">scope.  These  latter  efforts  would  encompass  not  only  full  Jews  who  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fessed  the  religion  or  possessed  four  Jewish  grandparents,  but  also  the  so- </p>
<p class="calibre1">called three-quarter, half, and one-quarter Jews of lesser Jewish lineage.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adolf  Hitler  was  personally  aware  of  preliminary  Hollerith  findings  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  only  about  a  half  million  Germans  registered  as  Jews  in  the  census,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">veins  of  many  more  coursed  with  traces  of  Jewish  blood.  About  a  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">more.9  He  wanted  something  done  about  the  continuing  Jewish  presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Jews  Hitler  feared  most  were  the  ones  not  apparent.  Der  Fuhrer  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  working  on  the  long-awaited  racial  definition  for  some  weeks,  but  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">enforceable formulae and calculations were still inconclusive.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  10,  1935,  he  flew  from  Berlin  to  Nuremberg  to  open </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Party  Day  celebrations.  Church  bells  sounded  and  flowers  were  thrown </p>
<p class="calibre1">adoringly  as  his  automobile  wended  through  the  streets  paced  by  newsreel </p>
<p class="calibre1">cars.  But  belying  the  flourish  was  a  Hitler  impatient  to  intensify  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">obliteration.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,  on  September  13,  1935,  Hitler  demanded  that  a  decree  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">hammered  out—now—within  forty-eight  hours,  in  time  for  his  appearance </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  the  Reichstag  as  the  culmination  of  Party  Day  festivities.  Top  racial </p>
<p class="calibre1">experts  of  the  Interior  Ministry  flew  in  for  the  assignment.  Working  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">drafts  shuttled  between  Hitler's  abode  and  police  headquarters,  twin  decrees </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  disenfranchisement  were  finally  patched  together.  The  Law  for  the  Protec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  German  Blood  and  a  companion  decree  entitled  the  Reich  Citizenship </p>
<p class="calibre1">Law  deprived  Jews  of  their  German  citizenship  and  now  used  the  term </p>
<p class="calibre1">explicitly—Jew,  not  non-Aryan.  Moreover,  Jews  were  proscribed  from  marry- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  or  having  sexual  relations  with  any  Aryan.  Jewish  employers  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  hire  an  Aryan  woman  under  the  age  of  45—a  concession  to  Streicher's </p>
<p class="calibre1">hysteria  regarding  sexual  perversion.  The  laws  would  apply  not  only  to  full </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews,  but  also  to  half  and  quarter  Jews  as  well,  all  according  to  complex </p>
<p class="calibre1">racial mathematics.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  decree  language,  the  precise  arithmetic  of  Jewish  ancestry </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  still  not  been  finalized.  How  could  one  differentiate  a  quarter  Jew  from  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">so-called  Mischling,  or  person  of  some  mixed  Aryan  and  Jewish  blood? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  it  would  be  months  of  drafting  and  redrafting  before  those  fractions </p>
<p class="calibre1">were finally settled.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laborious  and  protracted  paper  searches  of  individual  genealogical </p>
<p class="calibre1">records  were  possible.  But  each  case  could  take  months  of  intensive  research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  wasn't  fast  enough  for  the  Nazis.  Hitler  wanted  the  Jews  identified  en </p>
<p class="calibre1">masse.  Once  drafted,  the  Nuremberg  regulations  would  be  completely </p>
<p class="calibre1">dependent  upon  Hollerith  technology  for  the  fast,  wholesale  tracing  of  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  family  trees  that  the  Reich  demanded.  Hollerith  systems  offered  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  the  speed  and  scope  that  only  an  automated  system  could  to  identify </p>
<p class="calibre1">not only half and quarter Jews, but even eighth and sixteenth Jews.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  denouement  of  September  15  approaching,  Germany's  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">sense  of  Jewish  numbers  was  changing  dynamically.  As  Security  Police  Chief </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heydrich  had  concluded,  "it  has  become  apparent  that  a  great  number  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  in  Germany  have  become  baptized  in  the  Evangelical  and  Catholic </p>
<p class="calibre1">faiths  with  the  idea  that  once  they  changed  their  residence,  they  would  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">longer appear as Jews in the registries."15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier in 1935, the Party's Race Political Office had estimated the total </p>
<p class="calibre1">number of "race Jews." Thanks to Dehomag's people-counting methods, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis believed that the 1933 census, which recorded a half million observant </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, was now obsolete. Moreover, Nazis were convinced that the often- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quoted total of some 600,000 Jews, which was closer to Germany's 1925 </p>
<p class="calibre1">census, was a mere irrelevance. In mid-June 1935, Dr. Leonardo Conti, a key </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interior Ministry raceologist, declared 600,000 represented just the "practic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing Jews." The true number of racial Jews in the Reich, he insisted, exceeded </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.5 milli on. Conti, who would soon become the Ministry's State Secretary for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Health overseeing most race questions, was a key assistant to the officials </p>
<p class="calibre1">rishing to compose the Nuremberg Jewish laws for Hitler.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working in bureaucratic anterooms and elegant villas, the race scientists </p>
<p class="calibre1">tore up version after version until their paper supply ran out. So they finished </p>
<p class="calibre1">writing on menus. Finally, at 2:30 A.M. on September 15, armed with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">most up-to-date statistical information, the decrees were cobbled into pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sentable form.17 The scene was set for Hitler's announcement that evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At 9 P.M., September 15, a grandiose if improvised hall decorated with </p>
<p class="calibre1">streamers and ceiling fabrics was convened as a Reichstag for 600 deputies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They gathered for the sole purpose of ratifying the laws their Fuhrer would </p>
<p class="calibre1">declare. Hitler outwardly appeared as his usual charismatic self, carefully </p>
<p class="calibre1">stirred in riding pants tucked into polished jack-boots, a red swastika arm- </p>
<p class="calibre1">band round his left elbow, and a tie neatly buried under a fully buttoned </p>
<p class="calibre1">soldier's  jacket.  His  hair,  austerely  slicked  to  one  side,  bannered  above  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">unmistakable  narrow  mustache  to  create  Nazism's  emblematic  face.  But  to  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">least some observing him, der Fuhrer seemed tired from the long debate over </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  definition.  From  his  seat  on  the  stage,  he  ascended  three  steps  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">podium overlooking a massive assembly of the devoted stretching dozens of </p>
<p class="calibre1">rows back and more dozens left and right of a great center aisle that was </p>
<p class="calibre1">empty except for the obligatory photographer and a newsreel cameraman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind, a full orchestra and organist sat stilled, their instruments set down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing him, thousands waited, rapt with anticipation.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's speech, revised at the last minute, lasted only twelve minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though passionate, and at times fiery, his voice sounded weak. He ram- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bled from point to point. Throughout, der Fuhrer tore into a world commu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nity  that  was  offending  German  honor  and  boycotting  German  goods.  As </p>
<p class="calibre1">usual,  he  blamed  the  Reich's  one  great  enemy.  "We  must  notice  here,"  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">accused,  "mostly  Jewish  elements  are  at  work."  He  ripped  into  "international </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  agitation"  and  declared,  "The  time  had  come  to  confront  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">interests with German national interest."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Referring  to  the  population  statistics  rendered  by  his  raceologists  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">rounding  off  the  numbers,  der  Fuhrer  cried  out,  "a  nation  of  65  million  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sons  has  a  right  to  demand  that  she  is  not  respected  less  than  the  arbitrari- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  of  2  million  persons."  For  the  first  time,  Hitler  had  left  behind  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-worn  totals  of  400,000  to  600,000  German  Jews  and  now  pronounced </p>
<p class="calibre1">the updated Hollerith tabulated numbers.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  racial  laws,  he  promised,  would  immediately  strip  German  Jews  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  citizenship,  even  more  severely  restrict  their  activities  and  outlaw  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">ability  to  hoist  a  German  flag.  More  than  once,  Hitler  remonstrated,  "the  law </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  only  an  attempt  at  legal  regulation.  However,  should  this  not  work  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">should  Jewish  agitation  within  and  without  Germany  continue,  we  will  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">examine the situation again."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gesturing  fanatically,  he  concluded  with  this  warning:  The  new  law  "is </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  attempt  at  the  legal  regulation  of  a  problem,  which,  if  it  fails,  must  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">turned over to the Nazi Party for final solution."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pleasant  Nuremberg  night  and  reverberating  Sieg  Heils  suddenly </p>
<p class="calibre1">turned  to  rain.  Hitler's  well-photographed  smile  was  now  nowhere  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">seen,  not  even  as  the  crowd  cheered  him  all  the  way  from  the  Reichstag  hall </p>
<p class="calibre1">to his hotel.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">new </p>
<p class="calibre1">formulaic </p>
<p class="calibre1">approach </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">persecution </p>
<p class="calibre1">exploded  into  worrisome  headlines.  Under  a  page  one  banner  story,  the  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  Times  lead  was  typical:  "National  Socialist  Germany  definitely  flung </p>
<p class="calibre1">down  the  gaundet  before  the  feet  of  Western  liberal  opinion  tonight  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">[and]  decreed  a  series  of  laws  that  put  Jews  beyond  the  legal  and  social  pale </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  German  nation."  The  paper  went  on  to  detail  the  legal  import  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestral fractions.24 The news was everywhere and inescapable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  League  of  Nations'  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  Coming  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  issued  all  member  governments  a  long,  detailed,  and  scathing </p>
<p class="calibre1">report  of  the  Reich's  determination  to  persecute  Jews  on  an  unprecedented </p>
<p class="calibre1">basis,  all  based  on  tabulating  the  percentages  of  their  ancestry.  The  report's </p>
<p class="calibre1">opening  page  sounded  a  special  alarm:  "Even  more  ominous  was  the  decla- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ration of the German Chancellor: '. . . should, however, the attempt at legal </p>
<p class="calibre1">regulation fail, then the  problem  must  be  turned  over  to  the  National  Socialist </p>
<p class="calibre1">Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">for </p>
<p class="calibre1">final </p>
<p class="calibre1">solution.' "25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  while  all  understood  the  evil  anti-Jewish  process  underway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">virtually  none  comprehended  the  technology  that  was  making  it  possible, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mechanics  were  less  than  a  mystery,  they  were  transparent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1935,  while  the  world  shook  at  a  rearmed  Germany  speeding  toward </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  war  of  European  conquest  and  total  Jewish  destruction,  one  man  saw  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">revulsion,  but  opportunity—not  horror  and  devastation,  but  profit  and  divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dends.  Thomas  Watson  and  IBM  indeed  accelerated  their  breakneck  alliance </p>
<p class="calibre1">with Nazism. Now Thomas Watson, through and because of IBM, would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become the commercial syndic of Germany, committed as never before to </p>
<p class="calibre1">global advocacy  for the  Third Reich,  helping his  utmost to  counteract </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's enemies and further der Fuhrer's military, political, economic, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-Semitic goals. Even as he continued as a statesman of American capital- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ism and a bulwark of international commerce, Watson would become a hero </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Nazi Germany—both to the common man and to Adolf Hitler himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NAZI GERMANY was IBM's second most important customer after the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business was good. Hitler needed Holleriths. Rigid dictatorial control </p>
<p class="calibre1">over all aspects of commerce and social life mandated endless reporting and </p>
<p class="calibre1">oversight. What's more, Germany's commercial isolation and preparation for </p>
<p class="calibre1">was compelled the National Socialist regime into a frenzied campaign of </p>
<p class="calibre1">autarky that necessitated upward spirals of surveillance and bureaucratic med- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dling into the smallest industrial details. Nazi planners wanted every object in </p>
<p class="calibre1">daily life—from trucks to paper clips—coded, inventoried, and regimented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how preoccupied with economic and armament drives, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich inculcated every program with its maniacal desire to eradicate the Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM was guided by one precept: know your customer, anticipate their </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs. Watson stayed close to his customer with frequent visits to Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">and continuous daily micro-managed oversight of the business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere one turned in America or Germany in 1935, it was clear </p>
<p class="calibre1">that identification and exclusion of the Jews was only the beginning. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">next step was confiscation and Aryanization. During the two previous years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">most Aryanizations were disorganized. Jews were forced from their business </p>
<p class="calibre1">or profession and then pressured to sell their enterprises to Aryans for a frac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  the  value.  Thousands  of  others  fled  the  country  as  refugees  with  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">portable possessions worriedly stuffed i n t o  bulging suitcases. Homes, vehicles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  chattels  were  left  behind,  often  to  be  seized  in  satisfaction  of  trumped-up </p>
<p class="calibre1">juridical penalties or simply taken over as abandoned property.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  presence  in  smaller  towns  now  became  the  most  precarious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  identified,  Jews  were  unable  to  earn  a  living,  then  unable  to  even  pur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chase  food  or  medical  supplies.  Local  shopkeepers,  kept  in  line  by  neighbor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hood  anti-Jewish  boycott  vigilantes,  prominently  displayed  signs  forbidding </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  to  shop  within.  Pointed  threats  and  a  late  night  visit  from  hooligans </p>
<p class="calibre1">usually  sealed  the  family's  departure  decision.  During  1935,  dozens  of  locali- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  were  able  to  post  signs  on  their  outskirts  declaring  that  they  were  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">free  and/or  Jews  were  no  longer  permitted  to  purchase  lands  or  even  enter </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  town  limits.  As  Jews  were  methodically  driven  to  lodge  with  friends  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">family  in  larger  cities,  they  left  behind  their  real  estate  and  often  much  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">their goods. Now the body of unattended Jewish property was growing.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  a  town  became  Jew-free,  it  became  a  publicized  event.  In  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many,  the  town  administration  or  local  Nazi  groups  would  eagerly  advertise </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  accomplishment.  Foreign  newspaper  and  radio  broadcasts  chronicling </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  oppression  frequently  reported  the  development  as  well.  Typical  was  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">article in the New York Times, May 28, 1935, headlined "All Jews Quit Hers- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bruck."  The  article  reported,  "A  swastika  flag  has  been  hoisted  over  a  house </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Hersbruck,  near  Nuremberg,  which  has  been  the  home  of  the  last  remain- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing Jewish resident in the district."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  didn't  need  to  read  about  Aryanization  in  newspapers.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  it  personally.  In  July  1935,  Watson  visited  Berlin.  That  July,  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">thugs  ran  wild  in  the  streets  of  Berlin  smashing  the  windows  of  fashionable </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  stores.  One  of  those  department  stores  was  owned  by  the  Wertheims, </p>
<p class="calibre1">family  friends  of  the  Watsons.  The  Watson  family  learned  that  to  protect  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">store,  Mr.  Wertheim  first  transferred  the  property  to  his  Aryan  wife,  but  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimately  decided  to  sell  "for  next  to  nothing"  and  escape  to  Sweden.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  visit to  Berlin,  the  Watsons  and  other  IBM  executives  were  invited  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  elegant  reception  at  the  Japanese  embassy.  While  sipping  tea  in  the  gar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">den,  a  German  diplomat  boasted  that  the  exquisite  home  formerly  belonged </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  Jew  who  fled  the  country.  Such  new  ownership  of  greatly  discounted </p>
<p class="calibre1">homes was now common in Berlin.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  late  1935,  however,  the  Nazis  envisioned  a  more  systematic  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">state-controlled  process  to  expropriating  Jewish  property.  Just  after  the  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">actment  of  the  Nuremberg  Laws,  the  Nazis  began  floating  plans  for  a  clear- </p>
<p class="calibre1">inghouse to gobble up all Jewish holdings for a pittance. This plan was no </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret. I was widely promoted in Germany through the Party's Economic </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Agency. And the news traveled abroad. A New York Times article </p>
<p class="calibre1">on September 24, 1935, was headlined "Nazis Plan to Buy Out All Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firms; Stress Bargains Resulting from the Boycott." The article reported, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The plan calls for the purchase of Jewish firms by a central corporation, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">their distribution among ambitious Aryan businessmen. It is suggested that </p>
<p class="calibre1">such businesses can be obtained cheaply.. . . The Nazi organ responsible for </p>
<p class="calibre1">this ' solution of the Jewish problem' makes startling guesses as to what the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prices would be. It says, 'some fairly large Jewish firms can be purchased for </p>
<p class="calibre1">40,000 marks' Evidendy . . . the Jews can be induced to feel a very pressing </p>
<p class="calibre1">desire to sell." The newspaper noted that under such conditions, Jews might </p>
<p class="calibre1">then be faced either with the prospect of "emigration or semi-starvation."30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As part of the drive to liquidate Jewish assets, Nazis began visiting Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish homes and invalidating their passports. Now Jews could not even become </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees without paying a confiscatory flight tax of 25 percent of their hold- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ings in Germany.31 Identifying Jewish possessions was the next step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Banks, financial institutions, and pension funds were among Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">most important clients. Indeed, Dehomag maintained an entire department </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the banking industry. IBM designed highly specialized tabulating equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment for banks, including the BK and BKZ models, which were capable of </p>
<p class="calibre1">producing customer statements and recording specific transactions. On Au- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gust 12, 1935, savings banks were suddenly required to provide the Reichs- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bank with detailed information about all their depositors. Some banks used </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Hollerith process by coding accounts into one of ten professional cate- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gories Dehomag had established. Hollerith Nachrichten published a notice for </p>
<p class="calibre1">those institutions that did not yet own sorting machines, advertising that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag could do the sorting in-house for a fee. The company bragged that </p>
<p class="calibre1">it possessed the ability to cross-reference account numbers on bank deposits </p>
<p class="calibre1">with census data, including grouping by profession or industry.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's financial documentation capabilities soared when it unveiled </p>
<p class="calibre1">a powerful new model dubbed the D-11, which could process numerous </p>
<p class="calibre1">account developments, compute interest, and help create detailed customer </p>
<p class="calibre1">records. Within months, the new D-11 would allow high-speed data manage- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment of bank accounts at dazzling levels.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the human identification process proliferated. Local </p>
<p class="calibre1">and regional statistical offices registered new births on Hollerith cards, care- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fully noting the religion of both parents. Marriages were also registered on </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch cards, again noting the religion of both partners. These cards were </p>
<p class="calibre1">then forwarded to regional Dehomag service bureaus, such as the one in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saarbrucken  at  Adolf  Hitlerstrasse  80.  More  than  half  the  local  regional  sta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tistical  offices  operated  card  punchers,  but  could  not  purchase  their  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorters  because  of  the  backlog  and  expense  of  the  machines.  So  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">conducted  the  sorts  on  its  own  premises,  just  as  it  did  for  so  many  tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  Once  Dehomag  completed  its  work,  the  data  was  sent  on  to  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical  Office  where  it  was  combined  with  a  confluence  of  other  data </p>
<p class="calibre1">streams.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personal  information  about  Jewish  people  in  Germany  was  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">changing—precisely  because  of  the  innumerable  dislocations  Jews  suffered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  this  reason,  starting  in  1935,  the  authorities  required  Jewish  communal </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaders  to  report  their  members  by  age  and  gender  no  longer  annually,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">quarterly.35  Such  data  was  just  one  more  trickle  comprising  the  river  of  cross- </p>
<p class="calibre1">indexed information Hitlerites processed to isolate the Jewish nemesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  the  Hitler  regime  felt  statistically  ready  to  espouse  regula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions defining just what constituted a Jewish business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  firm  was  labeled  "Jewish"  if  the  owner  or  a  partner  was  Jewish,  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  a  single  Jew  were  in  management  or  on  the  board  of  directors.  If  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter  of  its  shares  or  votes  were  held  by  Jews,  or  under  Jewish  influence </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  nominees  or  agents,  the  company  was  classed  Jewish;  this  regulation </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  it  increasingly  difficult  and  dangerous  to  mask  ownership.  A  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  owned  and  operated  by  undisputed  Aryans,  but  if  it  maintained  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">branch managed by a Jew, that branch would be declared Jewish.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally,  it  would  be  impossible  to  certify  a  company  as  being  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">unless  denouncers  knew  the  identities  of  all  business  principals  and  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">profoundly  certain  which  of  those  individuals  qualified  as  Jewish  under  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuremberg  Laws.  But  fewer  Jews  could  hide  from  the  dragnet  IBM  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  the  Reich  construct.  This  forced  companies  to  quickly  identify  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">terminate,  even  if  reluctandy,  any  of  its  Jewish  management,  and  even  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">own Jewish ownership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  a  company  was  deemed  to  be  Jewish,  as  defined  under  the  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">regulations,  its  inventory  and  assets  would  ultimately  be  registered.  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">systems  that  could  inventory  people  could  inventory  merchandise  as  well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  Dehomag's  most  important  customers  were  the  Trade  Statistics  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Hamburg,  the  Reichspost,  and  various  national  and  local  taxing  offices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Decrees  of  the  Reich  Economics  Ministry's  Kommissar  for  Price  Control,  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ginning  in  1936,  required  uniform  reporting  procedures  by  key  industries.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  cases,  the  installation  of  IBM  machinery  was  mandatory  in  order  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">comply.  Government  statisticians  and  Dehomag  had  developed  coding  sys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tems for virtually all raw materials and finished goods. Eventually, the coding </p>
<p class="calibre1">system  would  make  it  possible  for  the  Nazis  to  organize  its  seizures  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">stunning specificity.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">None of Germany's statistical programs came easy. All of them required </p>
<p class="calibre1">on-going technical innovation. Every project required specific customized </p>
<p class="calibre1">applications with Dehomag engineers carefully devising a column and corre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sponding hole to carry the intended information. Dummy cards were first </p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully mocked-up in pen and pencil to make sure all categories and their </p>
<p class="calibre1">placement were acceptable to both Dehomag and the reporting agency. No </p>
<p class="calibre1">information could be input unless it conformed to Dehomag specifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the Reich tailored its data collection to match Hollerith require- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments. Moreover, there was only one source to purchase the cards: Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The company sold them, generally in lots of 10,000, often preprinted with </p>
<p class="calibre1">project names. Of course, once Dehomag approved the formats, it trained the </p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting agency's personnel to execute the work.38 Dehomag was Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">data maestro. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the frenetic rush to expand business with the Nazis and auto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mate more and more Reich projects, never once was a word of restraint </p>
<p class="calibre1">uttered by Watson about Dehomag's indispensable activities in support of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish persecution. No brakes. No cautions. Indeed, to protest Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">crusade against Jewish existence would be nothing less than criticizing the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company's number two customer. Despite the innumerable opportunities to </p>
<p class="calibre1">disengage or decline to escalate involvement in the war against the Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM never backed away. In fact, the opposite occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  became  intensely  proud  of  the  German  subsidiary's  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plishments.  In  late  November  1935,  two  months  after  the  Nuremberg  Laws </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  espoused,  and  just  days  after  more  headlines  were  made  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  issued  highly  detailed  genealogical  dicta  defining  just  who  was  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">under  the  decree,  Watson  traveled  to  Berlin  to  celebrate  Dehomag's  twenty- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifth  anniversary.  A  lavish  company  banquet  was  scheduled  for  November  27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  exclusive  Hotel  Adlon.  More  than  150  invitations  were  distributed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM offices in New York, Switzerland, Italy, France, and Norway were repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sented  by  their  top  executives.  Dignitaries  such  as  U.S.  Ambassador  to  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many,  William  E.  Dodd,  Hitler's  press  attache,  Ernst  Hanfstaengl,  former </p>
<p class="calibre1">German consul in New York, Otto Kiep, and Reich Economics Minister, Hjal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mar  Schacht  were  invited.  Important  industrial  contacts  were  on  the  list. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if some, such as Schacht, could not attend, most did.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sumptuous food was served in the Watson tradition of elaborate dinner </p>
<p class="calibre1">events. The Heidingers, Rottkes, and Watsons toasted their success. But even </p>
<p class="calibre1">as the precious crystal glinted and ornate silverware gleamed, the utilitarian </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  rooms  of  Lichterfelde  and  countless  other  data  processing  offices </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  Germany  continued  their  own  demographic  clatter.  The  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">never slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  everyone  could  be  as  jubilant  and  splendid  as  the  Watson  revelers </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  Hotel  Adlon.  Unseen  and  unheard  were  Jews,  cowering  in  t h e i r  </p>
<p class="calibre1">homes,  fearing  visibility.  Goebbels  had  already  warned  them.  "We  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">spared  the  Jews,"  asserted  Goebbels,  "but  if  they  imagine  they  can  just  stroll </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  the  [fashionable]  Kurfurstendamm  as  if  nothing  at  all  had  happened </p>
<p class="calibre1">let  them  take  my  words  as  a  last  warning."  In  another  warning,  Goebbels </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded,  "Jews  must  learn  to  break  with  their  past  behavior  and  leave </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  places  in  Germany  to  the  Germans."  These  were  not  quiet  comments </p>
<p class="calibre1">murmured  at  obscure  party  meetings  but  public  threats  reprinted  worldwide, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including in the New York Times under headlines such as "Nazi Warns Jews to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stay at Home."40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  Watson  eagerly  launched  a  program  to  expand  Dehomag's  capabil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity.  Ten  more  boxes  of  machinery  had  been  shipped from  New  York  to  Ham- </p>
<p class="calibre1">burg  in  November  1935  on  the  SS  Hansa.  Millions  of  additional  punch  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  rushed  across  the  ocean  until  Dehomag  could  produce  them  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Branch  offices  were  opened  throughout  the  Reich,  the  Lichterfelde </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  was  enlarged,  and  a  second  factory  was  established  to  manufacture </p>
<p class="calibre1">spare parts.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  in  Berlin  that  November  1935,  Watson  attempted  to  gain  techni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal  information  from  Dr.  Fels,  a  key  Reich  Statistical  Office  expert  who  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  organize  the  1933  census.  Watson  learned  that  despite  Fels'  expertise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  had  been  ousted  from  his  position  because  he  was  Jewish.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">delivered  a  note  to  Watson's  hotel  explaining  that  Fels  was  now  living  as  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">unemployed  refugee  with  his  family  in  New  York,  "in  quite  a  bit  of  misery." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  note  added  that  IBM  in  America  had  declined  to  give  him  a  job.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  wanted  Fels'  expertise.  So  immediately  upon  his  return  to  America </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  arranged  a  meeting.  On  February  3,  1936,  Fels  briefed  Watson  in  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manhattan  office  and  they  spoke  of  such  wide-ranging  issues  as  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">census  and  the  prospects  for  similar  projects  elsewhere.  As  for  employment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  did  assure  he  would  ask  around  and  see  if  any  of  the  many  organiza- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions he was associated with might offer Fels a job.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  Fels  briefing,  joint  exchanges  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  IBM  NY  and  Dehomag  sales  and  technical  staff  became  constant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  exchanges  were  highly  selective,  well  thought  out,  and  very  costly </p>
<p class="calibre1">investments  in  future  work.  Dozens  of  Dehomag  salesmen,  engineers,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers came to America for training and exchange of expertise. IBM es- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tablished a special sales training s c h o o l  in Endicott, New York, predomi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mantly attended by German and other European IBMers. Sales training was </p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary because despite all the proliferation in punch card systems, repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sentatives encountered continual resistance from government officials on just </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  the  elaborate  new  technology  worked.  At  Endicott,  salesmen  learned </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  to  fire  the  imagination  of  bureaucrats  and  convince  them  that  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  could  provide  solutions  for  any  governmental  requirement—no </p>
<p class="calibre1">matter how unprecedented.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four of IBM NY's brightest engineers and managers, all of Germanic </p>
<p class="calibre1">descent, were eventually transferred from America to the Berlin operation: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter Scharr in 1936, and Otto Haug, Erich Perschkc, and Oskar Hoermann </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the following years.  One Austrian  inventor, Gustav Tauschek, was  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">prized, he demanded—and was granted—an annual contract guaranteeing </p>
<p class="calibre1">him six months with IBM in the United States and six months in his beloved </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austria. Tauschek generated dozens of valuable patents. Indeed, anticipating </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's expansion, IBM NY filed for patents in various European coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries to protect the inventions of its German subsidiary.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">New devices never stopped appearing. Numbered gang punches type </p>
<p class="calibre1">501 multiple punching. Electrical interpreters type 550 for analysis. Elec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trical accounting machine type 400 for zone punching. Summary punch type </p>
<p class="calibre1">516 for cumulative information. Dehomag developed its own motor-driven </p>
<p class="calibre1">duplicating printing punch type 016 for high-speed processing, and calculating </p>
<p class="calibre1">punches type 621 and type 623. Multiplying punches were able to tally the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sum of two punched holes on a single card, shortening sort time. High-speed </p>
<p class="calibre1">reproducers, alphabetic tabulators, numeric and alphabetic interpreters, hori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">zontal sorters—a parade of metal magicians joined the repertoire.45 Many of </p>
<p class="calibre1">these devices were of course dual-purpose. They as routinely helped build </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's general commercial, social, and military infrastructure as they </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped a heightening tower of Nazi statistical offensives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Germany, some of the devices, such as the IBM Fingerprint Selecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sorter, were only usable by Nazi security forces.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specialized printing presses for punch cards were finally installed in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1935, allowing Dehomag to print its own punch cards. In a typical eight-hour </p>
<p class="calibre1">shift, allowing for pauses to change plates and re-ink, each press could pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duce 65,000 cards. Within two years, IBM would install fifty-nine such </p>
<p class="calibre1">presses in Germany—fifty-two from the only European press source that </p>
<p class="calibre1">could manufacture them, and seven from the United States, including several </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-speed units five times faster than the European models.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1936, Dehomag opened its first full-time school for customer train- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing. Courses for beginning card  punchers typically required two weeks of </p>
<p class="calibre1">intensive study. Additional courses were needed to master the more delicate </p>
<p class="calibre1">skills  of  operating  the  sorters  and  tabulators.  Each  new  device  required  addi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  training.  A  Development  Laboratory,  staffed  by  ten  engineers,  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened.  Initial  projects  included  high-speed  punches  and  automatic  paper </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeders  for  the  new  D-11.  Ironically,  despite  all  its  increased  factory  space, </p>
<p class="calibre1">technical  support  from  America,  and  extra  investment,  demand  was  so  high </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Dehomag  was  still  two  years  behind  in  filling  its  mounting  list  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">orders.48  It  was  a  never-ending  batde  to  supply  systems.  And  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed them so urgendy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  WAS  MAKING  a  fortune.  Since  the  day  Hitler  came  to  power,  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  had  been  reaping  millions  from  its  German  operation.  How  many  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions  might  never  be  known  because  the  company  buried  its  profits  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">bizarre  inter-company  transactions.  But  the  outward  manifestations  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">growth  and  prosperity  and  the  "admitted  profits"  it  reported  were  amazing </p>
<p class="calibre1">to a nation struggling to recover from the Depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"December  1933  was  the  largest  December  in  the  company's  history," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  boasted  to  stockholders  during  one  early  1934  meeting.  He  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  January  1934  was  also  the  largest  January  in  the  company's  history  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">February  1934  saw  conceded  profits  of  $103,000  above  the  year  before.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  predicted  the  trend  would  continue  throughout  1934.  These  profits </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  declared  despite  every  attempt  to  weave  revenues  into  complicated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">untaxable  inter-company  shunts.  Net  income  for  1933—to  the  extent  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified  given  blocked  accounts  in  Germany—was  reported  as  $5.73  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion,  including  income  from  foreign  subsidiaries.  Most  telling,  of  $55.4  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion in assets, $16.2 million was surplus cash.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Net  income  for  the  first  six  months  of  1934  was  $3.4  million  over  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">$2.9  million  posted  in  1933,  even  after  adjusting  for  various  inter-company </p>
<p class="calibre1">charges.  Income  increased  to  $5  million  for  the  first  nine  months  of  the  year, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  $7.18  per  share  over  $6.22  per  share  the  previous  year.  A  dividend  of  2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent was declared in addition to the regular quarterly dividend.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally  impressive  to  the  business  press  were  the  numbers  for  1935. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  began  the  year  by  predicting  IBM's  continued  upsurge.  "Our  trade </p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad  is  improving,"  reassured  Watson,  "as  shown  by  the  fact  that  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first  ten  months  of  1934  our  exports  increased  about  35  percent  over  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">corresponding  period  of  1933.  One  of  the  main  factors  contributing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial recovery may be found in the constandy increasing cooperation </p>
<p class="calibre1">among political, industrial and financial leaders." Million-dollar profits con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinued to rise in  1935. Shares for the year bloated to $9.38.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">However  the  funds  were  classed  or  categorized,  Dehomag  alone  paid </p>
<p class="calibre1">some $4.5 m i l l i o n  in dividends to I B M  during the early Hitler years.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM announced it would erect a building at 32nd Street and Fifth </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avenue in Manhattan. Then the company purchased $1,000 life insurance </p>
<p class="calibre1">policies for all 6,900 of its employees on the job since January 1933 or ear- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lier. While dedicating a new addition to the company's plant in Endicott just </p>
<p class="calibre1">before Christmas 1934, Watson extravagantly announced a Yule gift—a 37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent minimum wage increase for 7,000 workers. Shortly thereafter, news- </p>
<p class="calibre1">papers revealed that Watson had become the highest paid executive in Amer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ica. They dubbed him the "thousand dollar per day man." Watson received a </p>
<p class="calibre1">bonus of 5 percent of all IBM profits worldwide.  So his  total   salary </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounted to $364,432 per year, or nearly as much as the combined salaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the chairmen of Chrysler and General Motors. With characteristic aplomb, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson defended his  unprecedented  compensation.  Then IBM  bought </p>
<p class="calibre1">another Manhattan building site, this one at 57th and Madison.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In mid-1935, Congress had passed a new law with an extraordinary </p>
<p class="calibre1">impact on IBM: the Social Security Act. Congress had invented a bureau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cracy no one was sure could even be implemented. Social Security would </p>
<p class="calibre1">require a central file on nearly 30 million Americans.54 Until this point </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith systems had still not attained the technologic ability to create a sin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gle central registry. That is why so many repetitive sorts by statistical agen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cies were undertaken and updated so frequently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Social Security law was passed, no budget appropriation and </p>
<p class="calibre1">no infrastructure were in place because bureaucrats were convinced that </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the machinery ... to do the job . . . did not exist." Nor did the first Social </p>
<p class="calibre1">Security officials believe that nearly 30 million Americans could be quickly </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched into a first-time-ever system, and then sorted, assigned a number, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and eventually alphabetized. Nor did anyone imagine that such voluminous </p>
<p class="calibre1">records could be searchable and retrievable based on name and number.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith machines, as they were understood to exist in America at the </p>
<p class="calibre1">time, could do no more than add, subtract, tabulate, and tally punch cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Social Security required collation, "the ability to take two sets of records </p>
<p class="calibre1">and do a [simultaneous] matching to see whether . . . they were related to </p>
<p class="calibre1">one another," as government technicians described it.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  the  amazement  of  the  bureaucrats,  IBM  was  ready.  The  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  quickly  able  to  unveil  a  so-called  "collator"  that  could  achieve  precisely </p>
<p class="calibre1">what the government had in mind: compare and cross-reference two sets of </p>
<p class="calibre1">records in a single operation. Therefore, it was not necessary for the govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment to invent its own equipment. IBM would provide the solution.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington  awarded  I B M   an  on-going  contract  so  substantial  it  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">manently  boosted  IBM  into  a  corporate  class  of  its  own.  Watson's  people </p>
<p class="calibre1">boasted  that  Social  Security  was  "the  biggest  accounting  operation  of  all- </p>
<p class="calibre1">time."  Actually,  it  was  the  second  biggest.  The  dress  rehearsal  had  already </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  place  in  Germany  in  1933.  It  will  never  be  known  whether  the  collator </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  invented  in  Germany  or  the  United  States,  or  as  a  collaborative  effort  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  cross-Atlantic  development  programs.  But  shortly  after  it  appeared  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  United  States,  the  collator  also  appeared  in  Dehomag's  inventory.  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  was  so  impressed  with  the  talented  machine,  the  subsidiary  deployed </p>
<p class="calibre1">dozens of them, and planned to produce or import 50,000 more.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  moment  Washington  anointed  IBM  with  the  Social  Security </p>
<p class="calibre1">contract,  the  company's  income  catapulted  six-fold  within  several  years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Social  Security  and  a  diverse  parade  of  lucrative  contracts  from  the  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  of  Labor  to  the  War  Department  created  a  veritable  federal  partnership </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  IBM.59  The  company  became  quasi-governmental.  Large-scale  research </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  development  into  punch  card  registration,  identification,  and  storage </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  retrieval  systems  were  now  funded  by  the  U.S.  government  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  Germany.  IBM's  technology  jumped.  As  a  result  of  massive  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">taxpayer-funded  research,  more  people-managing  punch  card  capabilities </p>
<p class="calibre1">than ever before would be available to the Hitler regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WATSON'S  STRUGGLE  to  retain  profit  in  Nazi  Germany  was  all  consuming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  regulations  were  constantly  tightening  the  rules  for  business  in  cash- </p>
<p class="calibre1">starved  Germany.  Austerity  measures  required  ever-increasing  domination  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">industry.  Moreover,  Heidinger  never  paused  in  his  batde  to  reap  his  portion </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Dehomag  money.  Watson  could  handle  Reich  regulations.  But  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger was something else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barely  a  day  passed  without  numerous  position  papers,  contract  drafts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">legal  opinions,  and  explanatory  memos  wafting  between  IBM  offices  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva,  Paris,  Berlin,  and  New  York  trying  to  maintain  an  edge  in  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">profit  war  with  Heidinger.  Every  time  one  fire  seemed  doused,  new  flames </p>
<p class="calibre1">erupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  IBM  was  faced  with  a  Dehomag  profit  of  RM  1.2  million  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of 1934. Watson didn't want to pay the taxes in either Germany or the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United States. To both take the profit, yet make it disappear, European auditors </p>
<p class="calibre1">in late February 1935 concluded that "the new Dehomag will simply have to </p>
<p class="calibre1">show a deficit as of December 31, 1934, after payment of the RM 1.2 million </p>
<p class="calibre1">1934  dividends.  The  deficit  will  be  made  up  within  the  first  few  months  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1935." That dividend of course would be classed a "royalty," making it ap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pear  as  an  expense.  However,  at  about the  same  time,  even  the  royalty  loop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hole  dried  up.  IBM  accountants  reported  to  IBM  that  "royalty  payment  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  is  no  longer  possible."  Confronted  with  a  technical  deficit  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first  quarter  of  1935  and  unable  to  transfer  profit,  Dehomag  petitioned  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  authorities  for  temporary  tax  relief,  claiming  "a  hardship."60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem was that Heidinger earnestly wanted a profit shown so </p>
<p class="calibre1">he could qualify for a bonus. Without a formal profit showing, Heidinger's 10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent bonus  would  never materialize.  Before the merger,  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">was accustomed to receiving a monthly bonus of RM 10,000. Under the new </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangement, IBM reaped huge earnings as royalties or other "fees," but </p>
<p class="calibre1">his income suddenly disappeared. Until the profits could again be declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger demanded a monthly "loan" of RM 5,000 just to make living </p>
<p class="calibre1">expenses.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  Watson  could  authorize  it.  He  did  agree,  but  kept  Heidinger  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">short  leash.  The  loans  would  extend  only  until  August  1935,  at  which  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the whole position will be reviewed again."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon learning of his temporary morsel, Heidinger, on March 3, 1935, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shot off a saccharine thank you to IBM NY Vice President Otto Braitmayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was indeed a great pleasure for me to receive . . . your kind letter of Feb- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ruary 21 by which you allow me to receive from the Dehomag during the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first eight months of this year a monthly advance of RM 5,000—instead of </p>
<p class="calibre1">dividends which will be declared later on. . . . thank you very much for your </p>
<p class="calibre1">kind thinking of me on occasion of my 60th birthday . . . which brings me </p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly into your class of age."63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  then  an  additional  Reich  regulation  hit,  this  one  completely  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cutting  windfall  profits.  New  rules  prohibited  distributed  profits  in  the  form </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  dividends  above  8  percent  of  a  company's  original  investment.  Since </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  soaring  profits  were  now  vasdy  in  excess  of  IBM's  original  capi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">t al i zat i on,  the  dividend  cap  applied.  As  it  became  increasingly  difficult  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  to  extract  monies  from  Germany,  profits  still  remained  undeclared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  that  no  matter  what  was  done,  Dehomag's  growing  business  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">money but profit was never declared.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  IBM  comptroller's  analysis  conceded  that  by  fiddling  with  losses,  "It </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  obvious  that  Mr.  Heidinger  would  draw  about  40  percent  of  the  total  divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dends  which  could  be  declared."  At  the  same  time,  the  analysis  added,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">would only be able to receive 60 percent of what it was expecting.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  Heidinger  caught  on  that  I B M   losses  were  just  as  valuable  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">profits.  If  he  couldn't  get  a  bonus  on  profit—he  demanded  it  on  the  losses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  IBM  managers  were  unable  to  deny  the  logic.  "Mr.  Heidinger  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">justified  to  a  certain  extent,"  conceded  one  internal  memorandum,  "in  asking </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  losses  in  the  other  divisions  be  taken  into  consideration  .  .  .  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">... the surplus is reduced."66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  agreed  to  give  Heidinger  a  bonus  on  losses,  but  struggled  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">phrase  the  arrangement  since  German  taxing  authorities  would  never  believe </p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine  losses  could  create  a  bonus.  Finally,  to  assuage  Heidinger,  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  agreed  to  declare  a  phantom  dividend  first,  pay  Heidinger  a  10  percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">bonus  on  that  amount,  and  then  recast  those  same  numbers  as  losses  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid tax.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  what  should  be  done  with  the  blocked  funds?  In  July  1935,  during </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  Dehomag  board  meeting  Watson  attended  in  Berlin,  he  directed  that  "the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  should  rather  remain  invested  in  the  firm  and  be  credited  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">license  account  [royalties],  as  direct  remittances  are  not  possible."  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  offered  extra  incentives,  such  as  insurance  and  a  generous  pension.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  feisty  German  agreed,  but  that  only  postponed  the  next  round  of  finan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial fisticuffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  to  realize  blocked  profits,  Watson  channeled  money  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">tangible  assets.  He  expanded  Dehomag's  Lichterfelde  factory,  retrofitted  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">old  underutilized  pre-merger  facility  in  Sindelfingen  outside  Stuttgart,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">installed  additional  card  printing  presses.  The  race  was  on  to  build  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">presses  and  expand  factories,  because  shortly,  the  Reich  would  decree </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  German  companies  could  no  longer  pay  for  any  imports  from  America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  rules  prohibited  such  imports,  by  either  cash  or  credit.  Hence  intra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  accounts  could  no  longer  be  manipulated  to  create  losses.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  no  longer  mask  as  a  legitimate  expense  its  own  machinery  shipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  one  IBM  company  address  to  another.  The  German  subsidiary  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">have to become completely self-sufficient.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke  bragged  to  the  Dehomag  board  chairman  in  New  York  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  beat  the  new  regulations  because  "I  have  still  imported  as  much  mer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chandise  as  ever  possible"  from  IBM  NY  before  the  new  regulations  took </p>
<p class="calibre1">effect.70  Stockpiling  IBM  supplies,  machines,  spare  parts,  fabricating  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  and  punch  cards  meant  that  Dehomag  received  a  decisive  manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  impetus  without  the  need  to  remit  any  money  to  New  York.  That  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">strengthened  Dehomag's  balance  sheet,  and  made  it  a  more  powerful  compo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nent of IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now surplus cash escalated in Germany beyond even Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs. Watson needed to invest  in German assets that  would retain their </p>
<p class="calibre1">value. They could be sold later. Eventually, IB M  commissioned its outside </p>
<p class="calibre1">auditors—Price Waterhouse—to join IBM managers in making investment </p>
<p class="calibre1">recommendations. An extensive written report was submitted. Stocks of </p>
<p class="calibre1">other German companies were considered too volatile. Timberlands were </p>
<p class="calibre1">debated, but deemed unlikely to be approved by the Reich as a precious nat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ural resource. Buying an independent paper factory was rejected since paper </p>
<p class="calibre1">was now highly regulated by the Reich.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rental  property  might  be  acquired,  preferably  in  Berlin,"  an  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  manager  suggested  to  Watson  in  a  letter.  The  decision  was  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's. He chose apartment buildings. These could be turned over to local </p>
<p class="calibre1">rental  agents  for  leasing,  thereby  generating  income  as  well.72  Berlin  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">filled with some very discounted real estate at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  began  buying  apartment  buildings.  The  properties  purchased </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  prime  locations,  but  reliable  sources  of  rental  income.  One  building </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  at  Schutzenstrasse  15/17.  A  second  was  at  Markgrafenstrasse  25.  Attor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ney  Konrad  Matzdorf,  whose  office  was  near  one  of  the  addresses,  managed </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  sites,  and  according  to  one  IBM  assessment,  "accumulated  a  substantial </p>
<p class="calibre1">amount of money for the rentals."73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As IBM plowed its Reichsmarks into hard assets, it already anticipated a </p>
<p class="calibre1">wider European presence. In 1935, Watson shifted the company's European </p>
<p class="calibre1">headquarters from Paris to a city with a better banking environment, Geneva, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switzerland. A Price Waterhouse report later confirmed that while dividends </p>
<p class="calibre1">and profits destined for the United States were indeed blocked in Germany, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the regulations quoted above do not apply to transfers to Denmark, Bel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gium, Holland, Switzerland and Italy, since these countries have made spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial arrangements with Germany in connection with the transfer of interest </p>
<p class="calibre1">and dividend payments."74 As it happened, IBM maintained operations in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Italy, and now Switzerland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the arrangement to pay Heidinger bonuses on losses origi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated in 1935, the small print of any agreement with the Dehomag founder </p>
<p class="calibre1">consumed months of wrangling. During that time, IBM was astonished to </p>
<p class="calibre1">learn that Heidinger had never quite filed all the many merger papers from </p>
<p class="calibre1">1934, thus preserving some or all of his original corporate compensation </p>
<p class="calibre1">rights. More than that, the language in some of the merger documents Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger drew up was so convoluted, no IBM translator could understand it. At </p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of 1935, an IBM manager confessed to New York, "the translation is </p>
<p class="calibre1">still very confusing and actually it is hard to tell exactly what it means. Also </p>
<p class="calibre1">you will be interested to know that both Mr. Rottke and Mr. Zimmerman of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  German  company  are  unable  to  determine  the  exact  meaning  of  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man original."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pure  and  simple,  Heidinger  would  not  finalize  the  merger  papers  until </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  bonus  was  rectified.  The  matter  had  been  dragging  on  since  late  1933. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  operating  companies  that  arguably  did  not  quite  legally  exist  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">lack of the proper paperwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  and  for  all,  IBM  wanted  to  straighten  out  its  contractual  messes </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Heidinger.  Both  sides,  in  spring  1936,  agreed  to  new  bonus  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  visited  New  York  in  early  1936  to  attend  the  Hundred  Percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">Club,  the  international  IBM  celebration  of  those  executives  meeting  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeding  their  annual  sales  quota.  Dehomag  was  always  the  number  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign  revenue  producer.  While  Heidinger  was  in  New  York,  there  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">plenty  of  face-to-face  time  for  him  and  Watson  to  work  out  the  smallest </p>
<p class="calibre1">details  of  the  final  agreement  governing  the  merger  and  bonus.  A  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  was  crafted  by  a  Berlin  attorney  confirming  that  the  contract  was  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  private  undertaking  between  two  stockholders  with  Dehomag,  not  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  in  his  capacity  as  chairman  of  IBM.  This  continued  the  fiction  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag was not under foreign influence.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  little  trust  remained  that  each  side  secured  its  own  attorney.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vice President Braitmayer sent a letter to a European manager in Geneva, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  postscript  asserted,  "You  will  understand  that  I  wish  to  avoid  any  unnec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">essary  legal  expenses,  yet  it  is  essential  that  IBM  interests  be  fully  protected </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  that  you  avoid  any  such  complications  as  were  involved  in  the  1934  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tract  drawn  by  Mr.  Heidinger."  Braitmayer  added,  "I  am  depending  upon  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  use  some  tact and judgment  in  handling  this  situation.  And  I  hope  you  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">understand that this letter is [only] for the perusal of yourself."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  on  June  10,  1936,  with  numerous  translations,  multiple  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lated  copies,  attorneys  in  abundance,  and  signatures  inked  everywhere,  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">extensive  array  of  eight  document  sets  was  executed,  thus  finalizing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  merger  of  1933  and  securing  Heidinger's  bonuses.  To  further  bol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ster  the  image  of  German  ownership,  IBM  ultimately  arranged  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">"loans"  for  directors  Hermann  Rottke  and  Karl  Hummel  so  they  could  pur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chase  nominal  shares  of  Dehomag.  The  loans  were  collateralized  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares  themselves  and  neither  individual  enjoyed  "the  right  to  sell  or  transfer </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  any  third  parties"  any  of  their  shares.  No  money  changed  hands.  In  conse- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quence,  it  appeared  to  Reich  authorities  that  three  Germans  owned  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag, even if in fact it was controlled 100 percent by IBM NY.78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Watson reviewed a passel of final signed, notarized, sealed, and reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istered    documents,    America's    most      powerful    businessman    undoubtedly </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped  that  the  war  for  profits  in  Germany  was  over.  Heidinger  might  now  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">pacified. Watson was wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMAN  JEWRY  did  not  understand  how,  but  the  Reich  seemed  to  be  ail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">knowing  as  it  identified  and  encircled  them,  and  then  systematically  wrung </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  dignity  from  their  lives.  Indeed,  it  was  clear  to  the  world  that  somehow </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Reich  always  knew  the  names  even  if  no  one  quite  understood  how  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew the names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confiscation and Aryanization escalated throughout 1936, as did physi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal brutality. On September 8, 1936, a New York Times report headlined </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reich Seizing 25% of Fortune of Jews" reported: 'The order served on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews by local tax authorities demands that they deposit within eight days </p>
<p class="calibre1">'security' equal to the Reich escape tax . . . one-fourth their total assets. Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">on whom the order was served were frank in stating that sudden withdrawal </p>
<p class="calibre1">of 25 percent of their capital meant ruin to their business and nothing was </p>
<p class="calibre1">left except to shut down."79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On September 17,  1936, a New York Times report headlined "Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Penalties Heavier" reported:    "The Sturmer, Julius Streicher's anti-Semitic </p>
<p class="calibre1">weekly, announces that the Reich Justice Ministry has instructed public pros- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ecutors to demand more severe punishment for Jewish race defilers—Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">convicted of having had relations with German women. The Sturmer, which </p>
<p class="calibre1">regularly prints a list of Jews sentenced during the week throughout Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many, has long complained that German courts are too lenient.'"80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The day before, the New York Times was one of many publications </p>
<p class="calibre1">that printed Streicher's explicit remarks to newspapermen. The article, sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">headlined "The Way to Solve Problem Is to Exterminate Them," reported: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Nuremberg high-priest of anti-Semitism . . . announced that in the last </p>
<p class="calibre1">analysis, extermination is the only real solution to the Jewish problem. Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Streicher made it clear in his address that he was not discussing the question </p>
<p class="calibre1">in regard to Germany alone . . . but of a world problem. He declared there </p>
<p class="calibre1">were some who believed the Jewish question could be solved 'without </p>
<p class="calibre1">blood,' but. . . they were seriously mistaken. ... if a final solution was to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">reached 'one must go to the bloody path.' Such measures would be justified, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Streicher declared, 'because the Jews always attained their ends through </p>
<p class="calibre1">wholesale murder and have been responsible for wars and massacres. To se- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cure the safety of the whole world, they must be exterminated,' he said."81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world could not help but know the dismal result of Nazism. What </p>
<p class="calibre1">they did not read, they saw. Refugees were everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trains  screeched  into  Paris,  Prague,  Warsaw,  Brussels,  Geneva,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madrid.  Ships  lowered  their  gangplanks  at  Boston,  New  York,  Mexico  City, </p>
<p class="calibre1">London,  and  Johannesburg.  On  every  arrival,  refugees  were  an  unmistakable </p>
<p class="calibre1">sight.  Emerging  as  a  family  group,  wearing  their  finest,  towing  suitcases </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  footlockers  filled  with  clothes  and  memories,  they  stepped  with  hard- </p>
<p class="calibre1">summoned  pride  and  irrepressible  confusion  into  the  dim  of  displacement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  were  professors  toting  books  bundled  with  cord.  Some  were  doctors </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  lawyers  lugging  well-worn  briefcases.  A  number  were  merchants  stowing </p>
<p class="calibre1">precious  leather  ledger  books.  Not  all  of  them  were  Jewish.  Some  didn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  believe  they  were  Jewish.  Many  were  intellectuals  or  dissidents  of  vari- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ous  religions.  Children  were  told  stories  about  sudden  vacations.  Parents </p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered  what  the  night  would  bring.  Not  all  had  papers.  Some  carried </p>
<p class="calibre1">smuggled  gold  and  jewels  to  re-establish  themselves.  But  most  had  little  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">defray  their  existence.  The  machinery  of  confiscation  had  sent  them  out  vir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tually penniless or with their dwindled assets trapped in a hostile Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  amalgam  of  disorganized  rescue  and  relief  was  underway.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">League  of  Nations,  Jewish  organizations,  Zionist  bodies,  church  groups,  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernmental  committees,  labor  unions,  and  ad-hoc  municipal  agencies  strug- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gled  to  find  housing,  jobs,  and  moment-to-moment  succor  for  the  refugees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  all  of  the  several  dozen  helping  drew  upon  money  and  resources  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">fundamentally  did  not  exist  at  a  time  when  all  nations  were  suffering  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  weight  of  their  own  domestic  depression.  The  world's  brittle  ability  to  as- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sist  was  cracking.  By  late  1935,  more  than  125,000  had  escaped  Germany.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland,  more  than  5,000  had  arrived.  Czechoslovakia  also  extended  asylum </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  more  than  5,000.  Poland  absorbed  30,000.  France  had  received  30,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees  but  transferred  20,000  to  other  countries.  Nearly  37,000  had  es- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caped to the United States, Palestine, and Latin America.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  global  was  the  crisis  that  the  League  of  Nations  appointed  James  G. </p>
<p class="calibre1">McDonald  a  special  High  Commissioner  for  German  Refugees.  McDonald's </p>
<p class="calibre1">compelling  report  on  the  mounting  catastrophe,  issued  as  he  resigned  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">frustration,  declared,  "Perhaps  at  no  time  in  history  have  conditions  been  less </p>
<p class="calibre1">favorable  to  the  setdement  of  such  a  difficult  international  problem."  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">gates  were  closing.  Zionist  leader  Chaim  Weizmann  declared  the  world  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">divided  between  places  where  Jews  could  not  stay,  and  places  where  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">could not go.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  against  a  backdrop  of  human  misery  everywhere  that  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">proved that he was a special friend of the Nazi Reich. More than just his </p>
<p class="calibre1">investments in Germany, and his strategic socializing with German diplomats </p>
<p class="calibre1">and industrialists, Germany felt Watson was an ally in the Nazi battle for eco- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nomic recovery and conquest. Watson never spoke a word of cr i t i ci sm against </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  customer  Nazi  Germany.  But  more  than  that,  he  worked  to  breach  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">gorge  of  isolation  surrounding  the  Reich.  One  of  his  main  venues  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">International  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  its  U.S.  affiliate,  the  United  States </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chamber of Commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  American  Chamber  of  Commerce,  comprised  of  the  nation's  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful  magnates  and  corporate  executives,  was  a  powerful  political  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fluence  in  America.  Its  Foreign  Department  functioned  as  the  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">Section  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce.  The  ICC  was  a  non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">governmental  organization  created  by  the  League  of  Nations  to  promote </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  trade  and  study  the  hard  mechanics  of  treaties  governing  such  interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  commerce  as  postal,  shipping,  currency,  banking,  and  patent  rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  elected  chairman  of  the  Foreign  Department,  which  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  him  the  chairman  of  the  American  Section  of the  ICC.  This, in essence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made Watson America's official businessman to the world.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his new capacity, Watson seized the opportunity to rapidly organize </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Eighth Biennial Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  held in Paris in June 1935. Quickly, he secured the U.S. Government's </p>
<p class="calibre1">imprimatur for the event, thus elevating its status and glitter. To that end, </p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous letters were exchanged with Secretary of State Cordell Hull and </p>
<p class="calibre1">his subordinates. State Department officers were invited to sail on the same </p>
<p class="calibre1">ship with Watson and his ICC co-delegates as a cohesive entourage. Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can ambassadors, consuls, and attaches from across Europe were beckoned </p>
<p class="calibre1">t o   a t t e n d .  Hull himself was importuned by Watson for a message of con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gratulations  for  the  ICC's  related  Council  meeting  and  referring  to  "world </p>
<p class="calibre1">peace." Such a greeting from Hull, prominendy printed in program notes and </p>
<p class="calibre1">shown  to  key  contacts,  would  reinforce  the  image  of  Watson  as  a  political </p>
<p class="calibre1">dynamo within the Roosevelt Administration.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a flurry of minute revisions, Hull strung together a sequence of </p>
<p class="calibre1">inconsequential words that Watson could publish to show the American gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment's seeming approval of the Paris event and, more importandy, of Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's leadership of it. "I take this means," cabled Hull, "of expressing my </p>
<p class="calibre1">interest in the purpose of the meeting which you will attend to discuss ways </p>
<p class="calibre1">i n   w h i c h  business organizations can cooperate most effectively to secure a </p>
<p class="calibre1">more adequate and practical economic approach to world peace. The meet- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing is timely and I shall be glad to learn its results on your return."86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the bright glare of the international media, Watson assembled the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's  leading  corporate  leader  including  those  from  the  Third  Reich,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">discuss  the  most  pressing  economic  problems  of  the  day.  The  topics  debated: </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoidance  of  competitive  currency  depreciation;  uniform  treatment  of  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eign  corporations;  payment  of  international  debts;  and  international  protec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  inventions,  trademarks,  patents,  and  models.87  Grandiloquent  speeches </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  the  plenary,  debates  among  working  groups,  elaborate  communiques </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  government  leaders,  and  hastily  organized  press  dispatches  spodighted </p>
<p class="calibre1">the official agenda of the Congress.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  one  pressing  economic  topic  was  never  raised  during  the  eminent </p>
<p class="calibre1">conclaves.  The  issue  was  not  an  abstruse  fiscal  machination  that  dwelled  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  unnoticed  realms  of  international  economic  theory.  It  was  the  one  finan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial  crisis  that  threatened  to  overwhelm  civilized  governments  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Western  world  by  the  sheer  crush  of  its  tragic  sorrow  and  economic </p>
<p class="calibre1">implication. Refugees were never mentioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  whole  issue  of  the  Hitler  menace  was  sidestepped  as  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  encouraged  all  to  assume  a  "business  as  usual"  posture  with  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  Reich  craved  respite  from  the  torrent  of  international  criticism  bat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tering  its  economy.  Watson  did  what  he  could to  help.  Germany  believed  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">if  it  could  just  export  its  products  and  be  left  alone  to  pursue  its  militancy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich  would  prevail.  In  the  Nazi  mindset,  whenever  it  could  func- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion routinely in world commerce, it won fleeting validation for its course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  Paris  Congress,  Watson  was  elected  the  next  president  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  entire  ICC.  He  was  now  the  undisputed  paragon  of  world  trade.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  installed  as  president  at  the  next  ICC  Congress  scheduled  for  June </p>
<p class="calibre1">1937.  As  such,  he  was  proud  to  announce  his  personal  selection  for  the  host </p>
<p class="calibre1">site.  The  world  may  have  been  isolating  Germany.  All  Western  nations  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering  the  financial  burden  of  Nazi  oppression.  Refugees  flowed  to  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">cities.  Tension  arising  from  Hitler's  threats  of  invasion  and  exported  Fascism </p>
<p class="calibre1">spurred  an  expensive  arms  race.  But  Watson  staunchly  urged  all  to  join  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">in what he promised would be the biggest and most grandiose Congress yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  are  going  ...  to  Berlin,"  he  told  his  Chamber  colleagues.  "We  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">free  from  those  particular  antagonisms  which  strong  political  feelings  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">caused so much to break nations apart."89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  not  criticize  Hitler.  On  the  contrary,  in  his  coundess </p>
<p class="calibre1">interviews  and  public  speeches,  Watson  somehow  seemed  to  emphasize  ideas </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Reich  found  profoundly  supportive.  At  any  other  time  in  history,  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  words  might  have  been  received  as  visionary  gems.  But  in  the  tenor  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the times, they struck a chord of grateful resonance with the Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking at both IBM and ICC events, Watson regularly pleaded for </p>
<p class="calibre1">"an  equitablc  r e d i s t r i b u t i o n   of  n a t u r a l   resources,"  and  expressed  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">support  for  a  rearmed  Germany.  He  voiced  his  oft-quoted  opinions  at  a  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">when the Reich was daily violating the Versailles Treaty by rebuilding its war </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine,  and  threatening  to  invade  neighboring  regions  to  acquire  the  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">natural resources it felt it deserved.90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson was explicit at one key conference when he asked ICG col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leagues to press their contacts in government for "some sound understand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing in regard to limitation of armaments," and then admitted, "we are not </p>
<p class="calibre1">talking about disarmaments." As usual, he added that progress was needed </p>
<p class="calibre1">on one other point, "which is of the greatest of importance, a fairer distribu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of raw materials." Addressing the crippling boycott facing Germany, Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son repeated his mantra, ""We believe that as soon as we can have the proper </p>
<p class="calibre1">flow of trade both ways across the border, there will not be any need for sol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">diers crossing those boundaries."91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when spoken to his face, Watson maintained aphasic disregard </p>
<p class="calibre1">for any criticism of the Hitler regime. At an April 26, 1937, ICC banquet in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington preparatory to the Berlin Congress, the guest speaker was John </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foster  Dulles,  former  American  legal  counsel  to  the  Treaty  at  Versailles  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  the  nation's  foremost  international  law  experts.  His  presentation  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">entitled  "The  Fundamental  Causes  of  War."  Watson  was  not  happy  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">topic.  Before  Dulles  spoke,  Watson  even  lobbied  Dulles  to  change  the  title. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dulles  openly  quipped  that  Watson  had  complained:  "Nobody  wants  to  hear </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  war,  let's  hear  about  peace."  To  this,  Dulles  told  the  members,  "I  said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Alright, you [Watson] can write the title if I can write the speech. Before I get </p>
<p class="calibre1">through, I think you may wish that. . .  I had written the title and he had writ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ten th speech."92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dulles tore into Germany, saying all the things Watson had considered </p>
<p class="calibre1">impermissible. 'Take the case of Germany," said Dulles, with Watson standing </p>
<p class="calibre1">next to him. "Inability to get foreign exchange [due to the anti-Nazi boycott] </p>
<p class="calibre1">has blockaded Germany almost as effectively as she was blockaded during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the war by fleets and the armies of the Allies. There is a shortage of food, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">shortage of raw material, and the same sense of being circled by hostile </p>
<p class="calibre1">forces. ... It may be that in fact a country has all the facilities, which it </p>
<p class="calibre1">requires to develop within its borders . . .  It may be possible to prove all that </p>
<p class="calibre1">as a matter of logic. But logic has never cured a mental disease."93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caustically  declaring  that  the  well-worn  catchphrase  of  "peace"  ban- </p>
<p class="calibre1">died  by  Germany  and  its  intellectual  allies  was  a  fraud,  Dulles  forcefully </p>
<p class="calibre1">insisted.  "A  state  to  remain  peaceful,  must  afford  its  individual  citizens  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity to work and to enjoy the fruits of their labor. There must be no </p>
<p class="calibre1">undue  repression  of  the  individual  .  .  .  where  such  repression  occurs  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">large  scale  peace  is  threatened.  The  outbreak,  when  it  comes,  may  be  civil </p>
<p class="calibre1">war, but it may equally be international war."94 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Dulles  finished  his  long  speech,  Watson  declined  to  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledge  it  had  taken  place.  Departing  from  his  usual  toastmaster  effu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">siveness,  Watson  simply  introduced  the  next  speaker,  the  American  Secretary </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Agriculture. Minutes  later,  Watson  tried  to  counteract  Dulles'  comments  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">exhorting  his  fellow  entrepreneurs  to  support  the  ICC  gathering  in  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At  our  meeting  in  Berlin,"  urged  Watson,  "we  hope  to  see  as  many  of  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  as  possibly  can  get  over  because  it  is  of  great  importance  to  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">country that you be there and assist us in carrying on that meeting."95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  reviled  any  detraction  of  Germany.  One  typical  comment  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Associated  Press,  reported  in  the  New  York  Times,  used  some  of  the  same </p>
<p class="calibre1">formulations  Hitler  defenders  themselves  had  so  frequendy  invoked.  "Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  scoffed  at  the  possibility  of  another  world  war,"  said  the  Times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'World  peace,'  he  [Watson]  declared,  'will  result  when  the  nations  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  concentrate  on  their  own  problems  and  set  their  individual  houses  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">order.'"96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  challenged,  Watson  would  insist,  "I'm  an  optimist."  Those  among </p>
<p class="calibre1">friends  and  family  who  knew  him  best  later  tried  to  excuse  his  behavior  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">"naive."97  But  there  was  none  shrewder  than  Watson.  He  calculated  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">words like a carpenter: measure twice, cut once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  confessed  his  feelings  shortly  thereafter  in  a  draft  letter  to  none </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  than  Reich  Economics  Minister  Schacht.  "I  have  felt  a  deep  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">concern  over  Germany's  fate,"  Watson  wrote,  "and  a  growing  attachment  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  many  Germans  with  whom  I  gained  contact  at  home  and  abroad.  Thi9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude  has  caused  me  to  give  public  utterance  to  my  impressions  and  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">victions  in  favor  of  Germany  at  a  time  when  public  opinion  in  my  country </p>
<p class="calibre1">and elsewhere was predominantly unfavorable."98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  Watson  knew  war  was  imminent.  So  did  Heidinger.  In  Octo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  1936,  long  before  the  intellectual  showdown  with  Dulles,  Heidinger  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  memo  to  IBM  NY  detailing  plans  to  build  bomb  shelters  for  Dehomag  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">case  war  broke  out.  "The  authorities  have  approached  us,"  reported  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger,  "with  demands  that  sufficient  care  should  be  taken  to  protect  our </p>
<p class="calibre1">plant  and  operations  against  air  attack.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  we  are  located </p>
<p class="calibre1">close  to  a  railway  station,  such  demands  seem  justified  ...  in  the  interest  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  safety  of  the  lives  of  the  workers  and  employees  ...  we  believe  we  should </p>
<p class="calibre1">recommend  immediately  the  setting  up  of  air  raid  shelters.  .  .  .  Something </p>
<p class="calibre1">must surely be done immediately."99 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  metric  specificity,  Dehomag's  memo  called  for  two  massive  bomb </p>
<p class="calibre1">shelters, each large enough for 950 people or a mass of machinery, as well as </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  underground  tunnel  linking  factory  buildings  at  the  Lichterfelde  complex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  bomb  shelters  were  later  approved  by  Watson.100  Thus  IBM  assured  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  punch  card  capability  would  be  protected  from  Allied  strikes,  even  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">those included American bombers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">T h o m a s   Watson was more than just a businessman selling boxes to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Reich. For his Promethean gift of punch card technology that enabled </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Reich to achieve undreamed of efficiencies both in its rearmament </p>
<p class="calibre1">p r o g r a m  and its war against the Jews, for his refusal to join the chorus of </p>
<p class="calibre1">strident anti-Nazi boycotters and isolators and instead open a commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">corridor the Reich could still navigate, for his willingness to bring the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's commercial summit to Berlin, for his value as a Roosevelt crony, for </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  glitter  and  legend,  Hitler  would  bestow  upon  Thomas  Watson  a  medal— </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">highest </p>
<p class="calibre1">it </p>
<p class="calibre1">could </p>
<p class="calibre1">confer </p>
<p class="calibre1">on </p>
<p class="calibre1">any </p>
<p class="calibre1">non-German. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Merit  Cross  of  the  German  Eagle  with  Star  was  created  for  Thomas </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  to  "honor  foreign  nationals  who  made  themselves  deserving  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  Reich."  It  ranked  second  in  prestige  only  to  Hitler's  German  Grand </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  honored.  At  the  next  ICC  Congress,  he  would  not  only  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">installed as president of the ICC, he would be decorated by der Fuhrer. Work- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  with  Goebbels  as  stage  manager,  Watson  would  make  the  1937  ICC  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ference  in  Berlin  a  commercial  homage  to  Germany.  Hitler  in  turn  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">make that event a national homage to Thomas Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE GREAT 24,000-ton oceanliner Manhattan brought ninety-five American </p>
<p class="calibre1">executives and their families to Hamburg on June 24, 1937, where they re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">freshed and boarded trains for Berlin to attend the ICC gathering. As usual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson made arrangements for the State Department, its ambassadors, con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">suls and other envoys to sail with the group or otherwise become abun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dantly visible. In Berlin, the Americans would join more than 2,500 delegates </p>
<p class="calibre1">and others from forty-two other countries marshaled by Watson to make a </p>
<p class="calibre1">strong showing. The group included 900 from Germany. The suites of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hotel Adlon, Bristol, and Continental were waiting. The Adlon doubled as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's nerve center for the Congress. Scenic tours were arranged for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">after hours.102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson had already declared that after the Berlin gathering he would </p>
<p class="calibre1">travel to Italy for a private meeting with Mussolini and that the next ICC </p>
<p class="calibre1">conference  scheduled  for  1939  would  be  held  in  Tokyo,  Germany's  Pacific </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally.  IBM  bad  been  cultivating  a  t h r i v i n g   business  in  Japan,  helping  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation develop its air force and aircraft carriers.103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greetings  to  the  Berlin  Congress  were  not  only  conveyed  by  Hull,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  time  President  Roosevelt  himself  issued  an  official,  if  innocuous,  felicita- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. Again, such communications emphasized Watson's primacy as  much as  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  event  itself.  "My  hearty  congratulations  and  warmest  greetings  on  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">election  as  President  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce,"  Roosevelt </p>
<p class="calibre1">cabled  the  Adlon.  "For  many  years,  I  have  followed  with  interest  your  efforts </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  advance  the  work  of  this  organization.  .  .  .  Your  Congress  in  Berlin  is  tak- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  place  at  a  time  when  many  serious  problems  call  for  wise  and  mature </p>
<p class="calibre1">counsel.  .  .  .  On  this  very  important  occasion,  I  extend  to  you  and  to  the  par- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ticipating  delegations  my  best  wishes  for  a  successful  conclusion  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberations."104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  June  28,  1937,  over  a  peaceful  cup  of  tea  served  in  dainty  china  cups </p>
<p class="calibre1">atop  elegant  saucers,  in  a  quiet  corner  of  the  Reich  Chancellery,  huddling </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  a  small  serving  table  and  seated  on  cushy,  floral  armchairs,  Watson  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  would  finally  talk.  Sitting  with  them  was  a  Hitler  cohort  and  two  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">prominent  Hitler  supporters  from  the  ICC  convention.  No  one  knows  exactly </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  Hitler  told  Watson  during  their  exchange.  Watson  paraphrased  it  later </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the New York Times as, "There will be no war. No country wants war, no </p>
<p class="calibre1">country  can  afford  it."105  But  no  one  really  ever  knew  the  exact  exchange </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  the  men.  Whatever  Hitler  did  say,  Watson  was  encouraged  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">entranced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  the  ICC  thousands  assembled  at  the  German  Opera  House, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  doubled  as  the  Reichstag.  Nazi  flags  fluttered  monumentally  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">balconies  as  a  massive  orchestra  played  Beethoven's  Lenore  Overture  #3. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The New York Times reported, "At times . . .  it seemed to be a purely National </p>
<p class="calibre1">Socialist rally."106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  then  Adolf  Hitler  suddenly  walked  in.  Dressed  in  his  familiar </p>
<p class="calibre1">brown  party  uniform,  he  made  his  way  direcdy  to  the  royal  box  festooned </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  swastika  flag.  As  he  did,  the  familiar  command  crackled  through  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">air: "Sieg!"107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  assemblage  of  distinctive  businessmen,  including  dozens  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  of  America,  in  the  year  1937,  gripped  by  the  moment,  awed  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  occasion,  imbued  with  the  spirit,  under  the  leadership  of  Thomas  J. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  jumped  to  their  feet  amid  roars,  cheers,  and  wild  applause,  reached </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the sky in a loyal salute and chanted back   "Heil!"108 Watson lifted </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  right  arm  halfway  up  before  he  caught  himself.  Later,  a  colleague  denied </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  reported  for  the  New  York  Herald  that  Watson's  gesture  was  a  genuine </p>
<p class="calibre1">salute.109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermann  Goering  was  one  of  the  first  main  speakers.  He  hammered  at  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  constant  themes.  The  Third  Reich's  "mighty  rearmament,"  Goering </p>
<p class="calibre1">insisted,  was  merely  to  defend  Germany's  long  borders  and  protect  her  honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  demanded  justice  for  Germany,  and  access  to  the  raw  materials  she  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">entitled  to.  Reichsbank  President  Hjalmar  Schacht  in  his  address  also  stressed </p>
<p class="calibre1">"honest  raw  material  distribution."110  Many  more  Nazi  speakers  argued  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">case, hopeful for appeasement if possible, committed to conquest if necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  Schacht,  whose  rhetoric  was  generally  subdued,  described  racial </p>
<p class="calibre1">prerogatives  that  arose  from  a  "Godgiven  division  of  nations  according  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">race."111  When  the  plenary  finally  dismissed,  a  signal  was  given  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">orchestra played the theme of the Storm Troopers, the "Horst Wessel Song" and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  the  German  national anthem,  "Deutschland  uber  Alles."  Caught up in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">hypnotic  invigoration  of  it  all,  delegates  sang  along  with  stalwart  Brown </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shirts.112  Then  the  merriment  began  in  earnest.  Berlin  had  not  seen  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">monarchical  a  reception  in  recent  memory.  Watson  was  wined,  dined,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">honored  everywhere  in  Berlin.  Josef  and  Magda  Goebbels  entertained  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watsons at the Opera House. The Schachts invited the Watsons and delegates to </p>
<p class="calibre1">a grand party for hundreds at the Berlin Palace. The Goerings hosted a majestic </p>
<p class="calibre1">banquet  for  the  Watsons  and  delegation  presidents  at  the  immense </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlottenburg  Palace.  Berlin's  mayor  organized  a  sumptuous  dinner  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">delegates.113  But  all  prior  splendor  was  surpassed  by  the  elaborate  Venetian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nights  staged  by  Goebbels  on  Peacock  Island,  an  extravaganza  thought  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">many to be the grandest party of the Nazi era. Located a short drive from Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">in pastoral Wannsee, Friedrich Wilhelm Ill's romantic eighteenth-century castle </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Peacock  Island  had  been  converted  for  the  evening  into  an  Arabesque </p>
<p class="calibre1">fantasy at a cost of 4 million Reichsmarks. Watson and the other guests crossed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  isle  atop  a  narrow  pontoon  bridge,  which  brought  them  to  a  long  path </p>
<p class="calibre1">lined  with  hundreds  of  charming  Berlin  schoolgirls  daintily  outfitted  in  white </p>
<p class="calibre1">blouses over white silk breeches and white leather slippers. Each girl waved a </p>
<p class="calibre1">white  fairy's  wand  and  angelically  bowed  as  Watson  and  his  fellow </p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialists  promenaded  in.114  Three  thousand—some  said  four  thousand—</p>
<p class="calibre1">guests were then invited to imbibe at a bar of seemingly endless length, manned </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  eighty  bartenders  pouring  and  mixing  any  cocktail,  vintage  cognac,  fine </p>
<p class="calibre1">wine, or robust beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corks  popped  continuously  as  champagne  flowed  with  abandon.  A  regal  din- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner  remembered  as  gigantic  was  served  to  hundreds  of  tables,  each  seating </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  many  as  twelve.  Thousands  of  chefs,  waiters,  and  their  kitchen  helpers </p>
<p class="calibre1">whisked  dome  after  dome  of  gourmet  specialties  back  and  forth  across  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">lawns  in  a  spectacular  demonstration  of  precision  table  service.  Enchanting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prussian  porcelain  figurines  were  bestowed  upon  the  wives.  Ballerinas  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">singers  from  a  nearby  artist's  colony  performed  an  enchanted  display  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">dance  and  song  beneath  a  prodigious  rotunda,  which  later  became  an  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mense dance floor.115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  no  fanfare  could  compare  with  the  crowning  moment,  the  decora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  Watson.  Hitler's  medal  was  bestowed  by  Schacht  as  newsreel  cameras </p>
<p class="calibre1">whirred  and  government  functionaries  snapped  to  stiff  attention.  The  eight- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed  gold-framed  cross  of  white  enamel  embedded  with  German  eagles </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Nazi  emblems  dangled  about  the  neck  from  a  broad  red,  black,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">white  ribbon  in  tandem  with  a  second  six-pointed  star  worn  over  the  left </p>
<p class="calibre1">breast.  To  Watson,  it  was  magnificent.  When  wearing  it,  he  was  draped  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">two swastikas, one to the right and one to the left.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  majesty  and  fantasy  of  Berlin  1937  swept  Watson  and  IBM  into  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever  more  entangled  alliance—now  not  only  in  Germany,  but  in  every  coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">try  of  Europe.  Soon,  the  metallic  syncopation  of  Hollerith  technology  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">echo  across  the  continent.  There  were  frightening  new  applications  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards  in  store,  applications  no  civilized  person  could  envision.  France, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland, Italy, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Norway, Romania, Hungary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the other nations would soon be set ablaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through  it  all,  the  songs  never  stopped.  Swaying  with  exuberance,  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed in one color, lyrics shouted in almost hypnotic fervor, the songs never </p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped. Endicott reverberated with the prospects as followers sang out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's the spirit that has brought us fame! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We're big, but bigger we will be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We can't fail </p>
<p class="calibre1">for all can see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We fought our way through—and new </p>
