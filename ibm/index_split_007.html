<p class="calibre1">through </p>
<p class="calibre1">world </p>
<p class="calibre1">trade."9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  advocacy  for  peace  was  limitless.  May  13,  1940,  was  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">claimed IBM Day at the World's Fair being held that month in New York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Day  was  nothing  less  than  an  extravaganza  of  orchestrated  adulation  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company.  A  dozen  chartered  trains  brought  in  7,000  IBM  employees  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  wives  from  company  facilities  across  the  nation  to  visit  the  architectonic </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Pavilion.  Each  IBMer  wore  a  red  ribbon  of  solidarity  with  the  company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two thousand lucky ones were chosen to be feted at a massive Waldorf-Asto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ria  dinner.  Special  congratulations  to  IBM,  as  usual,  were  issued  by  leading </p>
<p class="calibre1">politicians from President Roosevelt to the Mayor of New York. To underscore </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  drama,  Watson  commissioned  an  original  orchestral  work,  The  IBM  Sym- </p>
<p class="calibre1">phony, a bombastic composition dedicated to the uplifting spirit of the firm.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  climax  of  IBM  Day,  however,  was  Watson's  speech  on  the  subject </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  peace.  He  delivered  his  sermon  to  30,000  specially  invited  guests  gathered </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  vast  Court  of  Peace  located  in  front  of  the  sweeping  USA  Pavilion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mutual Radio broadcast the highly publicized event countrywide.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peace  was  Watson's  message.  War  was  bad,  he  argued  at  every  opportu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nity.  It  would  prove  nothing  but  military  might,  waste  lives  and  precious </p>
<p class="calibre1">resources.  War  was  in  fact  the  worst  recourse  for  the  world,  and  all  right- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking  men    should  be    opposed  to    any  involvement  with  it,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">pleaded.  As  head  of  the  Carnegie  Endowment  for  International  Peace,  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  everywhere  proclaimed  his  driving  mantra:  "World  Peace  through  World </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trade."  Indeed,  Watson  must  have  seemed  to  the  public  like  the  very  cham- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pion  of  peace  and  the  arch  adversary  of  all  conflict.  Ironically,  at  that  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">moment,  Watson  and  IBM  were  in  fact  Europe's  most  successful  organizers </p>
<p class="calibre1">not of peace, but of the ravages of war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  as  Watson  was  preaching  the  imperatives  of  peace,  IBM  was  ecsta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tic  about  its  accomplishments  revolutionizing  warfare  not  only  for  the  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich, but also for its Axis allies and even other European nations about to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">vanquished  by  Hitler.  In  spring  1940,  J.  W  Schotte,  IBM's  general  manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Europe,  dispatched  a  confidential  report  from  his  Geneva  office  to  senior </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM executives in America. Schotte's dispatch addressed the activities not only </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  just  Dehomag,  but  also  of  the  two  dozen  European  subsidiaries  and  agen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cies that worked as inter-connected branches of the New York company.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's  enthusiastic  memo  was  entitled  "Our  Dealings  with  War  Min- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istries  in  Europe."  It  began,  "Up  to  about  one  and  a  half  years  ago  [about </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  time  of  Krristallnacht  in  1938],  our  negotiations  with  the  war  ministries </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  twenty-four  countries  which  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  IBM  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean  headquarters  in  Geneva,  had  not  been  very  successful.  This  was  due </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  several  reasons,  but  mainly  to  the  fact  that  in  military  circles  administra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  was  considered  a  'necessary  evil'  of  little  importance  for  the  defense  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the country."13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had f i nal l y succeeded in gaining the necessary insider access to </p>
<p class="calibre1">sensitive military projects, Schotte reported, so that company engineers could </p>
<p class="calibre1">properly design punch card applications for war use. Schotte explained that </p>
<p class="calibre1">in prior years "the military men in Europe have been reluctant to reveal their </p>
<p class="calibre1">problems and programs to civilians. It has been overlooked in such instances </p>
<p class="calibre1">that there is a distinct difference between knowing which problems exist and </p>
<p class="calibre1">what system is applied, and the data and figures to which the system has to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be applied."14 As such, Schotte drew a fine theoretical distinction between </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM possessing specific knowledge of the facts about a military operation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such as the number of people to be counted or a list of German bombing </p>
<p class="calibre1">raids, and the actions themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The big change in military acceptance of Hollerith systems appeared at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of 1938, confirmed Schotte, when "in Germany a campaign started </p>
<p class="calibre1">for, what has been termed . . . 'organization of the second front.'" He elabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rated, "In military literature and in newspapers, the importance and neces- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sity of having in all phases of life, behind the front, an organization which </p>
<p class="calibre1">would remain intact and would function with 'Blitzkrieg' efficiency . . . was </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought out. What we had been preaching in vain for years all at once </p>
<p class="calibre1">began to be realized."15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's memo made clear that only at IBM's initiative did the mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tarists comprehend what magic they could achieve with Hollerith automa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. "Lectures on the punched card system were held by our representatives </p>
<p class="calibre1">before officials of the general staff of various countries and, with our men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the study of possible applications was begun . . . progress was rather slow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and it was not until about eight or nine months ago [summer 1939] when </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions in Europe clearly indicated that a war was more or less unavoid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able, that the matter became acute."16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Asserting that IBM sold to either side and had enjoyed an ever-escalating </p>
<p class="calibre1">volume since the summer of 1939, Schotte's memo declared, "The War Minis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries of Yugoslavia, Rumania, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Holland and France </p>
<p class="calibre1">(these  are  the  ones  that  I  remember  very  distinctly  from  memory)  sent  us  or- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ders for punched card equipment, some of which is already installed, others </p>
<p class="calibre1">being  installed  when  the  war  started,  and  further  equipment  not  yet  installed </p>
<p class="calibre1">or </p>
<p class="calibre1">still </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">transport."17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revenues  from  IBM's  dominant  customer,  the  Third  Reich,  was  grow- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  so  rapidly,  Schotte  said  he  did  not  yet  possess  the  sales  numbers.  "We </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  no  details  of  Germany,"  he  reported,  "but  know  that  a  large  amount  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched  card  equipment  is  being  used  by  the  War  Ministry."  He  added  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">so great was Germany's need in the months before and after the invasion of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland  that  the  Reich  began  requisitioning  machines.  Indeed,  the  agency </p>
<p class="calibre1">u l t i m a t e l y       known  as    the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen  (MB)  had  exercised  </p>
<p class="calibre1">full authority over all punch card technology since 1937. "In the second half of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1939,"  wrote  Schotte,  "most  of  our  equipment  was  'seized'  and  used  to  sup- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plement the installations already in operation."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  war  erupted,  the  haste  to  add  machines  for  military  use  was  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">confined  to  Germany.  Schotte's  report  noted  that  "rush  orders  were  placed </p>
<p class="calibre1">with us" by those countries not yet properly automated. Most IBM subsidiaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  two  years  behind  in  filling  orders,  so  many  war  ministries  hurried  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">orders  just  to  get  in  queue.  "To  make  up  for  lost  time,"  Schotte  continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Holland  and  France  gave  us  blank  orders  for  a  large  quantity  of  machines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although  our  studies  were  not  completed  for  several  of  the  uses,  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">quantities  of  required  machines  not  established.  As  late  as  February  1940, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the French War Ministry ordered a very substantial quantity of machines."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's  report  clarified  that  not  all  war  applications  were  handled </p>
<p class="calibre1">direcdy  by  war  ministries.  Numerous  systems  had  been  conveyed  to  private </p>
<p class="calibre1">industry,  "but  are  for  their  [war  ministry]  use  and  under  their  control." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  even  though  a  coal  mine  or  insurance  company  might  be  listed  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  account,  utilization  of  the  machines  was  dictated  by  military  needs  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  original  corporate  premises  or  moved  to  a  more  secure  location  alto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gether.  Indeed,  by  spring  1940,  his  memo  confirmed,  many  such  systems  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">already been relocated to more protected sites, the report acknowledged.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Widespread  expansion  of  punch  card  systems  for  war  was  ironically </p>
<p class="calibre1">undermined  in  various  countries  by  the  draft  itself,  which  infringed  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch    card    workforce,    asserted    Schotte.    However,    eventually,    military </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  exempted  "key  men  in  our  installations  [who  then]  remained  at  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">posts."    Moreover,    "supervisors    and    our  indispensable    servicemen    were </p>
<p class="calibre1">released  for  such  work."  Even  still,  he  added,  "A  great  inconvenience  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">caused  due  to  the  sudden  extension  of  equipment  in  most  countries,  a  short- </p>
<p class="calibre1">age  of  trained  supervisors  and  punch  operators.  Ads  were  placed  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">papers  and  such  operators  lured  away  from  one  installation  to  another  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">offering  higher  salaries.  We  hurriedly  started  training  schools  for  key  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">operators   and   supervisors,   and   of course   servicemen   who   would   be </p>
<p class="calibre1">exempted from military service due to age or physical condition."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe's  militarists  had  finally  realized  the  indispensable  advantages </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  instilled  into  modern  warfare,  boasted  Schotte.  Punch  cards  freed </p>
<p class="calibre1">up  manpower.  Schotte  cited  a  typical  case:  "For  example,  in  Hungary  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  set  of  machines  and  a  few  operators  we  replaced  about  sixty  men."  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">added that the machines "work twenty-four hours without vacation. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">place and location is immaterial and machines have been installed in bomb- </p>
<p class="calibre1">proof  cellars.  .  .  .  There  is  no  l i m i t   to  the  flexibility  and  adaptability  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines,  provided  the  mass  of  data  to  be  handled  is  sufficiendy  large."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  importandy,    stressed    Schotte,  Hollerith  machines    guaranteed </p>
<p class="calibre1">"speed  in  handling  mass  records  and  data.  Such  speed  would  be  absolutely </p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible </p>
<p class="calibre1">by </p>
<p class="calibre1">manual </p>
<p class="calibre1">methods," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he </p>
<p class="calibre1">stressed.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's  report  included  a  list  of  IBM's  remarkable  accomplishments </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  armies  of  war-ravaged  Europe.  Personal  information  about  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">officer  and  soldier  resided  on  Hollerith  systems.  In  France,  for  example,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">actual  "mobilization  call  to  each  officer  was  printed  by  our  equipment  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">means  of  punch  cards."  Hollerith  machines  controlled  all  payrolls  to  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">armies and civilian workers in munitions factories.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  comprehensive  was  IBM  Europe's  data  on  both  Germany  and  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemies  that  Schotte's  memo  was  able  to  assert  that  the  punch  cards  main- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tained "records of each and every Communist and Nazi."25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Records  were  also  kept  "on  skilled  laborers  by  profession,  industry,  etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  records  are  kept  to  control  the  potential  of  war  material  manufacture," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's memo specified.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  labor  data  tersely  alluded  to  in  just  a  few  words  in  Schotte's  memo </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  profoundly  vital  to  Hitler.  These  automated  reports  allowed  the  Reich  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">strategically  deploy  both  the  skilled  laborers  within  Germany  and  the  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scripted  work  brigades  and  slave  gangs  shipped  in  from  occupied  countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a daunting organizational challenge. By the end of 1940, the number of </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  onscripted  and  other  slave  workers  totaled  nearly  2.5  million.  Reporting </p>
<p class="calibre1">formats  continuously  evolved  as  the  Reich's  needs  changed  and  Hollerith  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology  improved  to  keep  up.  Eventually,  reporting  categories  included  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  considered  its  entire  manpower  pool,  from  company  owners  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">skilled  workers  to  unskilled  laborers,  divided  into  male  and  female  columns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  time  evolved,  the  various  cross-indexed  reports  further  classified  the  cate- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gories  into  "Reich  residents,  civilian  foreigners,  prisoners  and  Jews,"  as  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  others.  Germany's  punch  card  control  agency,  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coordinated  the  reports.  The  agency  considered  its  labor  data,  "without  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt,  MB's  most  important  statistical  survey  on  the  deployment  of  indi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">viduals,"  as  a  key  senior  MB  official  later  expressed  it.  "For  all  participating </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices,"  the  MB  officer  emphasized,  "this  was  the  major  tool  for  the  coordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation  and  surveillance  of  work  employment  in  the  individual  territories  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  entire  Reich.  Its  results  laid  the  foundation  for  the  ongoing  monthly </p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiations on the assignment of workers for armaments production."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three years later, Schotte, while in his New York office, would describe </p>
<p class="calibre1">to a government official exactly how the personnel tracking system worked in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-occupied  territories.  "For  example,"  wrote  the  official  that  Schotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">briefed,  "if  a  Gauleiter  [the  ranking  regional  Nazi  Party  official]  in  Poland </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs a number of technicians who speak Polish but are not Poles, it is possi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ble  to  secure  the  exact  names  and  locations  of  the  men  in  their  present  units </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  placing  the  punched  cards  in  the  sorting  machine  and  setting  the  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  provide  the  correct  answer.  When  the  required  number  has  been  deter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mined, the machine stops."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  weren't  all  that  IBM  counted  and  tracked.  Schotte,  in  his  spring </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940  memo  to  IBM,  was  also  proud  of  the  company's  ability  to  count  "ani- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mals: a record of each horse, mule, etc."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  mentioned  by  Schotte  only  in  passing,  animal  censuses  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">complex  logistical  projects.  The  Nazis  ordered  the  first  such  "horse  census" </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Poland  in  early  1940. Jews  operated  many  of  the  stables  and  equine  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  in  Poland.  As  part  of  the  confiscation  of  Jewish  assets,  horses  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">seized  and  then  mobilized  by  the  army  to  move  materials,  prisoners,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  corpse  wagons  through  the  frigid,  often  snowbound  Polish  countryside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well  as  the  cities.  By  seizing  horses,  the  Reich  also  cut  off  an  important </p>
<p class="calibre1">means  of  escape  for  Jews  fleeing  Nazi  invaders.  Orders  to  German  police </p>
<p class="calibre1">units  stationed  throughout  Poland  reflected  the  gravity  of  the  horse  count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  instructions  proclaimed:  "In  order  to  secure  the  Wehrmacht's  census  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">horses,  conducted  to  avoid  a  secret  shifting  around,  I  request  that  you,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">conjunction  with  the  county's  farmers  and  all  Wehrmacht  offices  dealing  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  horse  census,  employ  police  forces,  especially  at  night,  to  establish  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">horses  are  not  secretly  moved  from  their  census  districts  into  other  sections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captured  horses  which  may  have  been  moved  are  to  be  confiscated  and  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">owners  punished."  British  intelligence  agents  monitoring  the  horse  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  the  project  "tremendous,"  and  in  a  secret  report  could  only  marvel  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the "thoroughness of preparations."30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  spring  1940  cow  census  in  occupied  Belgium,  also  monitored  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">British  intelligence,  reflected  an  equal  feat  of  livestock  counting.  After  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">count, each animal was required to wear an identity card.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's  spring  1940  memo  also  listed  the  extraordinary  programs  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">material  control  covering  inventories  as  diverse  as  "arms,  clothes,  airplane </p>
<p class="calibre1">spare parts" and all raw materials, such as "rubber, oil, steel, iron." Moreover, </p>
<p class="calibre1">reported  Schotte's  report,  "records  [are]  kept  of  each  factory  with  the  type </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  class  of  its  machines"  and  whether  they  were  currently  being  used  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">battle or classed as potential suppliers.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In occupied lands, material censuses and registrations organized Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">plunder  of  resources.  For  example,  a  butter  census  was  scheduled  for  occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pied  Denmark  to  discover  large  stores  of  butter  hoarded  by  Danes.  As  rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">road  cars  loaded  with  the  material  and  merchandise  of  a  foreign  country </p>
<p class="calibre1">entered  Germany,  punch  cards  kept  track  of  the  inventory.  This  system  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">refined  as  the  months  progressed  and  as  Germany's  occupation  broadened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  later  described  the  evolved  system  for  a  government  official  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">summarized  it  this  way:  "The  original  inventory  throughout  a  country  is  rep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">resented  by  cards,"  the  official  wrote.  "For  a  period  of  ten  days  in  Germany, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  are  punched  of  incoming  and  outgoing  movements  and  then  at  the  end </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  ten  days  are  sorted  by  commodity,  together  with  the  inventory  card  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">[so] the inventory is never more than ten days behind time."33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's spring 1940 memo also cited the organization of all "automo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bile records: (military and in some cases also the private cars)." Private vehi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cles were routinely seized by invading Germans, first from Jews, and then from </p>
<p class="calibre1">other citizens as well. Identifying cars and trucks was one of the first statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">efforts Germany generally mounted after invading any foreign territory.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith machines were deeply involved in combat records as well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">according to Schotte's spring 1940 memo. For example, Luftwaffe missions </p>
<p class="calibre1">were all duly recorded to calculate the details of aviator combat, asserted the </p>
<p class="calibre1">report. Schotte's memo bragged that punch cards maintained a "record of </p>
<p class="calibre1">each flight of a military aviator, for his personal record and calculation of </p>
<p class="calibre1">premiums." In addition, all German war injuries were analyzed by complex </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith programs that allowed Reich planners at the Central Archive for </p>
<p class="calibre1">War Medicine in Berlin to conduct sophisticated medical research. In World </p>
<p class="calibre1">War I, it was Hollerith analyses of head-wound injuries that helped the Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trian military design the most protective helmet possible.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte's spring 1940 report also listed "decoding" of enemy dispatches </p>
<p class="calibre1">as a prime Hollerith application.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  each  month  advanced,  Hollerith  machines  became  more  involved </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  each  and  every  move  of  the  German  forces.  Eventually,  every  Nazi  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bat  order,  bullet,  and  troop  movement  was  tracked  on  an  IBM  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">system.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1940,  IBM  NY  knew  the  exact  location  of  its  machines  in  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  an  updated  basis.  Without  that  tracking,  it  could  not  audit  IBM  Europe's </p>
<p class="calibre1">charges  and  depreciate  its  equipment.  One  typical  machine  list  in  its  Manhat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tan  office  was  entitled  "International  Business  Machines  Corp.  New  York" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  labeled  in  German  words  "Machines  as  of  September  30,  1940."  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">particular  thirteen-page  inventory  identified  each  machine  by  client,  location, </p>
<p class="calibre1">type, serial number, and value. Five alphabetizes in the 405 model series, for </p>
<p class="calibre1">instance, were located at the German Army High Command. Those five </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines bore serial numbers 10161, 10209, 11316, 13126, and 13128, with </p>
<p class="calibre1">each one valued between RM 8,750 and RM 11.675.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  alphabetizers  were  placed  at  a  myriad  of  offices,  according  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">list,  including  various  military  inspectorates,  offices  of  the  punch  card  control </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency,  the  census  bureau,  the  branches  of  Reich  Statistical  Office,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic arms  manufacturers  such  as Krupp  and Junkers  Aircraft.  Again,  each </p>
<p class="calibre1">installation reflected the type of machine, serial number, and value.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  all  the  rush  orders  placed  into  the  militaries  of  such  countries </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  Holland  and  Poland  worked  to  the  Reich's  advantage.  When  the  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">invaded,  all  Hollerith  machines  were  seized  and  converted  to  German  use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  subsidiaries  were  then  on  hand  to  service  the  Reich's  needs.  Sales  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  enemies  never  bothered  IBM's  hypersensitive  Reich  sponsors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, some in the Nazi hierarchy may have even viewed such sales as a vir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tual  "pre-positioning"  of  equipment  in  neighboring  nations,  nations  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  throughout  Europe  and  America  expected  to  be  invaded  imminently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  case  of  Poland,  for  example,  IBM  leased  Hollerith  equipment  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish  military  in  1939  just  before  the  German  invasion,  and  then  immedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ately  after  the  invasion  created  a  new  Berlin-based  subsidiary  for  the  occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pied  territory.  Accounts  in  annexed  regions  were  transferred  to  Dehomag.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the case of Holland, systems were leased to the military in early 1940; a com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pletely  new  subsidiary  was  planned  in  March  1940,  just  weeks  before  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion, and rush-formalized just after the invasion.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  almost  single-handedly  brought  modern  warfare  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  age.  Through  its  persistent,  aggressive,  unfaltering  efforts,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">virtually  put the "blitz" in the  krieg for Nazi  Germany.  Simply  put,  IBM orga- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nized the organizers of Hitler's war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeping  corporate  distance  in  the  face  of  the  company's  mounting </p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement  was  now  more  imperative  than  ever.  Although  deniability  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">constructed  with  enough  care  to  last  for  decades,  the  undeniable  fact  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  either  IBM  NY  or  its  European  headquarters  in  Geneva  or  its  individual </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries,  depending  upon  the  year  and  locale,  maintained  intimate </p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge  of  each  and  every  application  wielded  by  Nazis.  This  knowledge </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  inherendy  revealed  by  an  omnipresent  paper  trail:  the  cards  themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM—and only IBM—printed all the cards. Billions of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  Herman  Hollerith  invented  his  tabulators  at  the  close  of  the  nine- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teenth  century,  the  feisty  inventor  had  fought  continuous  technologic  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">legal  battles  to  ensure  that  no  source  but  his  company  could  print  a  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">compatible with the sorter's complex mechanisms. Once a customer invested </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  Hollerith  machine,  the  customer  was  continuously  tied  to  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  punch  cards.  This  exclusivity  was  nothing  less  than  the  anchor  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">lucrative Hollerith monopoly.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson vigilantly continued Hollerith's legacy. During the Hitler years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Department of Justice litigated IBM's monopoly, focusing on the firm's </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret pacts with other potential manufacturers, which forbid any competi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion in punch card supply. Unique presses, extraordinary paper, near clinical </p>
<p class="calibre1">storage, exacting specifications, and special permission from Watson were </p>
<p class="calibre1">required for any IBM subsidiary to even begin printing cards anywhere in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the world. Should any non-IBM entity dare enter the field, Watson would </p>
<p class="calibre1">shut them down with court orders. For example, when the German paper </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacturer Euler, associated with the Powers Company, tried to print </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM-compatible punch cards, Watson restrained them with an injunction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For good measure, IBM wrote special clauses into its German contracts pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">h i b i t i n g  any client—whether an ordinary insurance company or the NSDAP </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself—from utilizing any card other than one produced by IBM. In short, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith cards could only be printed at IBM-owned and -operated printing </p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities and nowhere else.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  1935,  IBM  NY  was  the  sole  exporter  of  punch  cards  to  Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Eventually,  Watson  invested  in  high-speed  presses  for  Germany  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag   could  print  and  export  its  own  throughout  Europe.  During  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  few  years,  he  authorized  IBM  printing  presses  in  Austria,  Poland,  Hol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">land,  France,  and  greatly  expanded  capacity  in  Germany.  Deep  into  the  war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  late  as  1942  additional  IBM  printing  facilities  were  opened  in  Finland  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Denmark.  All  these  plants  acted  as  a  coordinated  cross-border  European  sup- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ply  line.  For  example,  in  the  first  three  months  of  1939  alone,  IBM  Sweden </p>
<p class="calibre1">sold  1.9  million  punch  cards  to  Denmark,  1.3  million  to  Finland,  and  696,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Norway. IBM NY sold 1 million cards to Yugoslavia and 700,000 to Fascist </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spain.  Dehomag  sold  261,000  to  Hungary.  It  was  all  done  under  the  constant </p>
<p class="calibre1">supervision  of  IBM  Geneva,  which  in  turn  kept  in  continuous  contact  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY.  European  General  Manager  Schotte  regularly  flew  back  and  forth </p>
<p class="calibre1">from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switzerland </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">America </p>
<p class="calibre1">conveying </p>
<p class="calibre1">reports.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  printed  billions  of  its  electrically  sensitive  cards  each  year  for  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  customers.  But  every  order  was  different.  Each  set  was  meticu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lously  designed  not  only  for  the  singular  client,  but  for  the  client's  specific </p>
<p class="calibre1">assignments.  The  design  work  was  not  a  rote  procedure,  but  an  intense  col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">laboration.  It  began  with  a  protracted  investigation  of  the  precise  data  needs </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  project,  as  well  as  the  people,  items,  or  services  being  tabulated.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">required IBM subsidiary "field engineers" to undertake invasive studies of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the subject being measured, often on-site. Was it people? Was it cattle? Was it </p>
<p class="calibre1">airplane engines? Was it pension payments? Was it slave labor? Different data </p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering and card layouts were required for each type of application.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  the  problem  was  intimately  understood,  Hollerith  technology  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully  wedded  to  the  specific  mission.  This  process  required  a  constant </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  and  forth  between  the  IBM  subsidiary's  technical  staff  and  client  user </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  they  jointly  designed  mock-up  punch  cards  to  be  compatible  with  the  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istration  forms,  and  then  ensured  that  the  plug  and  dial  tabulators  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">configured  to  extract  the  information.  Only  after  careful  approval  by  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM technicians and the client did the cards finally go to press.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  printed,  each  set  of  custom-designed  punch  cards  bore  its  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctive  look  for  its  highly  specialized  purpose.  Each  set  was  printed  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  own  job-specific  layout,  with  columns  arrayed  in  custom-tailored  configu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rations  and  then  preprinted  with  unique  column  labels.  Only  IBM  presses </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufactured  these  cards,  column  by  column,  with  the  preprinted  field  topic: </p>
<p class="calibre1">race,  nationality,  concentration  camp,  metal  drums,  combat  wounds  to  leg, </p>
<p class="calibre1">train  departure  vs.  train  arrival,  type  of  horse,  bank  account,  wages  owed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">property owed, physical racial features possessed—ad infinitum.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cards  printed  for  one  task  could  never  be  used  for  another.  Factory  pay- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roll  accounting  cards,  for  example,  could  not  be  utilized  by  the  SS  in  its  on- </p>
<p class="calibre1">going program of checking family backgrounds for racial features. Differences </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  cards  were  obvious.  Dehomag's  1942  accounting  cards  for  the  Bohler- </p>
<p class="calibre1">werk  Company,  for  instance,  featured  the  manufacturer's  name  centered.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  contained  only  14  columns  preprinted  with  such  headings  as  hours </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  above,  column  8,  pieces  produced  above  column  9,  and  suggested </p>
<p class="calibre1">processing  time  above column  11.  The right hand  third  of  the  punch card  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">empty:47  In  contrast,  SS  Race  Office  punch  cards,  printed  by  Dehomag  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">same year, featured a bold Rassenamt SS logo. Rassenamt cards carried custom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">labeled  columns  ior  years  of  marriage  above  column  7,  height  above  column </p>
<p class="calibre1">47, height while seated above column 48, and weight above column 49. A sepa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  grouping  on  the  Rassenamt  card  listed  "ethnic  categories,"  including  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">divisions such  as  Nordic  printed  above column  50,  Oriental above  column  57, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mongolian  above  column  59,  and  Negroid  above  column  60.  SS  Race  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards were crowded from margin to margin with column designations.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  1933  Prussian  census  cards  featured  a  large  Prussian  Statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tical  Office  label  and  used  only  48  columns  in  total.  The  census  card  bore </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  preprinted  demographic  headings  as  religion  over  column  24  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">mother  tongue  over  column  28;  columns  49-60  were  left  empty.  Coal  survey </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards listed sources, grades, and carloads. Luftwaffe cards listed bombing </p>
<p class="calibre1">runs  by  pilots.  Ghettoization  registration  cards  listed  Jews  block  by  block. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railroad punch cards listed cities along a route, schedule information, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the freight being hauled—whatever that freight might be.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each card bore the distinctive ownership imprimatur of the IBM sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary as well as the year and month of issue, printed in tiny letters— </p>
<p class="calibre1">generally red—along the short edge of the card. An IBM punch card could </p>
<p class="calibre1">only be used once. After a period of months, the gargantuan stacks of </p>
<p class="calibre1">processed cards were routinely destroyed. Billions more were needed each </p>
<p class="calibre1">year by the Greater Reich and its Axis allies, requiring a sophisticated logisti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal network of IBM authorized pulp mills, paper suppliers, and stock trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">port. Sales revenue for the lucrative supply of cards was continuously </p>
<p class="calibre1">funneled to IBM via various modalities, including its Geneva nexus.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slave labor cards were particularly complex on-going projects. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich was constandy changing map borders and Germanizing city and </p>
<p class="calibre1">regional names. Its labor needs became more and more demanding. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">type of punch card operation required numerous handwritten mock-ups and </p>
<p class="calibre1">regular revisions. For example, MB Projects 3090 and 3091 tracking slave </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor involved several mock-up cards, each clearly imprinted with Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag's name along the edge. Written in hand on a typical sample was the pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ject  assignment:  "work  deployment  of  POWs  and  prisoners  according  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  branches."  Toward  the  left,  a  column  was  hand-labeled  "number  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">employed during the month" next to another column  hand-marked "number of </p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  at  month's  end."  The  center  and  right-hand  column  headings  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">each scribbled in: French, Belgium, British, Yugoslavian, Polish.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  card  in  the  series  was  entitled  "registration  of  male  and  female </p>
<p class="calibre1">workers  and  employees."  Hand-scribbled  column  headings  itemized  such  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quered  territory  as  Bialystok  [Poland],  Netherlands,  Protectorate  [Czechoslo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vakia],  and  Croatia.  Noted  in  pen  near  the  bottom  were  special  instructions </p>
<p class="calibre1">about the left-hand row:  "columns 56-59 members of Polish ethnicity go with </p>
<p class="calibre1">hole 1 "and "columns 56-59 members of Ukrainian ethnicity go with hole 2."52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  another  Dehomag  mock-up  card  in  MB  Project  3090  was  hand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">titled      "registration  of  male  and  female  foreign  workers  and  employees."'The </p>
<p class="calibre1">scrawled column headings included: road worker, miners, textile workers, con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">struction workers, chemists, technicians.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cards were only the beginning. All decisions about precisely which col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">umn and which row could be punched in order to properly record, tabulate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and sort any portion of data were studiously determined in advance by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith engineers. Making the cards readable by IBM sorters required spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial settings on the machines that only company engineers could adjust. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">involved  review  of  machine  schematics  to  ascertain  which  adjustments  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed for each data run. Once an assignment was undertaken, the sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary  or  its  authorized  local  dealers  would  then  continuously  train  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  other  personnel  involved  to  use  the  equipment,  whether  puncher,  sorter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  tabulator.  The  delicate  machines,  easily  nudged  out  of  whack  by  their  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stant  syncopation,  were  serviced  on-site,  generally  monthly,  whether  that  site </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  in  the  registration  center  at  Mauthausen  concentration  camp,  the  SS </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices  at  Dachau,  or  the  census  bureau  in  any  country.54  Without  this  abun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dance  of  precision  planning,  assistance,  and  supply  of  systems,  IBM's  Hol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leriths just could not work—nor could their benefits be derived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally,  IBM  profits  boomed.  In  February  1940,  IBM  Geneva  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  a  month-by-month  review  of  Dehomag's  record  profit  increases  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the last half of 1939. June profits increased RM 96,680 over May profits. July </p>
<p class="calibre1">bettered  June's  amount  by  RM  123,015.  August  continued  to  set  another </p>
<p class="calibre1">record, beating July by RM 98,006, and so on for the rest of the year.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  April,  IBM  executives  in  both  Geneva  and  New  York  continued  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">marvel  at  Dehomag's  unprecedented  profit  increases,  including  the  unex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pected  nearly  RM  1.8  million  boost  in  December  1939.  Auditors  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">wait  for  details,  reporting,  "we  telegraphed  to  Berlin  for  further  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">which we are now awaiting."56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  never  clear  exacdy  how  much  true  profit  IBM  earned  worldwide </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  the  stealthy  way  its  many  subsidiaries  classified  and  reclassified </p>
<p class="calibre1">revenues  to  avoid  taxation.  Not  all  that  was  profitable  was  declared  a  profit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  in  mid-1940,  even  after  applying  its  best  accountancy  transmogrifi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cations,  the  New  York  office  was  compelled  to  announce  yet  another  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">string  of  profit  records,  this  one  for  the  first  half  of  the  year.  Just  less  than  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">$6  million  gross  profit  for  the  six-month  period  was  conceded,  and  that  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">without  adding  about  a  million-dollar  foreign  profit  blocked  in  Germany  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">elsewhere.  That  $6  million  half-year  profit  was  about  a  half  million  higher </p>
<p class="calibre1">than the same period a year before. Few in the financial community were sur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">prised.  IBM  profits  had  been  in  a  steep  climb  since  the  day  Hitler  came  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">power.57 Clearly, the war was good to IBM coffers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  in  many  ways  the  war  seemed  an  ideal  financial  opportunity  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson.  Like  many,  he fully  expected  Germany  to trample over  all of Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating a new economic order, one in which IBM would rule the data domain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like many, Watson expected that America would stay out of the war, and when </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was over, businessmen like him would pick up the post-war economic pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  Watson  began  planning  for  the  post-war  boom  and  a  complete </p>
<p class="calibre1">reorganization of the world's economic system almost as soon as the war </p>
<p class="calibre1">began.  By  late  April  1940,  he  had  convened  a  stellar  Committee  for  Eco- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nomic Reconstruction j o i n t l y  sponsored by the two organizations he domi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated, the ICC and the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. This group planned </p>
<p class="calibre1">to rewrite the rules of international trade and economic sovereignty, essen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tially parceling out the world's resources when the war concluded. Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced the plan to his fellow industrialists attending an April 29, 1940, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ICC dinner in Washington D.C. "Our program," asserted Watson, "is for </p>
<p class="calibre1">national committees in the individual countries to study their own problems </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the standpoint of what they need from other countries and what they </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  to  furnish  other  countries."  It  was  the  same  Hitleresque  message  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  had  been  preaching  for  years.  Some  countries,  both  men  believed,  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply  entided  to  the  natural  resources  of  another.  War  could  be  avoided  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceding these materials in advance.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  time  was  wasted  in  making  plans.  "We  are  carrying  on  just  as  though </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  wasn't  any  war,  if  you  can  believe  it,  and  probably  you  don't,"  declared </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eliot  Wadsworth,  chairman  of  the  ICC's  American  Committee,  when  he  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vened  the  April  29,  1940,  meeting.  Wadsworth,  a  Watson  confidant,  revealed </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  "already  two  meetings  have  been  held  among  representatives  of  the  sec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  of  the  International  Chamber  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  it  is  contradictory </p>

<p class="calibre1">many  have  allowed  the  representatives  of  their  sections  to  meet  in  friendly </p>
<p class="calibre1">discussion at The Hague to consider the ... future program."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  days  after  the  ICC's  dinner,  Hitler  launched  his  savage  Blitzkrieg </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasions  overrunning  Luxembourg,  Holland,  and  Belgium.  An  outraged </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  could  turn  nowhere  without  seeing  German  atrocities  depicted  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">newsreel  screens  or  the  front  pages  of  newspapers.  Horror  stories  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees,  governments-in-exile,  diplomats,  and  journalists  alike  would  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">stop.  Although  the  nation  was  divided  on  the  wisdom  of  entering  the  war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  nonetheless  felt  certain  America  would  soon  join  the  battle  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Anti-Nazi  sentiment  intensified.  A  Gallup  poll  taken  shortly  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Reich's  spring  offensive  began  showed  only  2  percent  of  Americans  felt </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's invasion of Belgium or Holland could be justified.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  public  mood  swelled  against  all  things  Nazi,  Watson  was  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">confronted with one major public relations problem: his medal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  all  the  persecutions,  atrocities,  plunder,  and  invasions,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">remained  the  proud  holder  of  der  Fuhrer's  Merit  Cross  of  the  German  Eagle </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Star  bestowed  in 1937  at the  ICC  Congress  in Berlin.  Hitler's  medal  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">a very public link. Holding it in the face of daily aggression was inherently an </p>
<p class="calibre1">acceptance of Hitler's actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  Watson  had  avoided  virtually  all  criticism  of  the  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">regime  beyond  offering  boyish  aphorisms  to  observe  the  Golden  Rule,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling  the  invasion  of  Poland  "a  difference  of  opinion."  He  could  not  afford </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  offend  his  second-biggest  customer,  a  customer  that  would  soon  emerge </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  new  dictatorial  ruler  of  Europe.  On  the  other  hand,  Watson  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">never  allow  his  legendary  and  patriotic  position  in  the  United  States  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">compromised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Events were squeezing Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  16,  1940,  the  day  after  Holland  capitulated,  Watson  did  as  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">always  did:  he  reached  out  to  his  friends  in  the  White  House  and  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  for  political  cover.  That  day,  he  dispatched  a  note  to  Secretary  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Cordell  Hull  asking  if  the  United  States  government  wanted  him  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">return  the  medal.  Watson  could  then  attribute  his  return  or  refusal  to  return </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  decoration  to  Hull's  specific  counsel.  Now,  however,  the  American  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment was openly anti-Nazi.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hull  would  not  even  become  involved.  The  Secretary  immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  back:  "I  feel  that  this  is  a  matter  upon  which  the  decision  will  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  rest  entirely  with  you,  and  is  not  one  upon  which  this  Government  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  able  to  take  a  position."  Hull  penned  a  personal  regret  in  the  margin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would offer advice to no person sooner than you."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four  days  later,  on  May  24,  Watson  took  his  first  overt  step  of  identifica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  with  the  victims  of  Nazi  aggression.  He  agreed  to  chair  an  emergency </p>
<p class="calibre1">committee to raise $3 million for the relief of Dutch refugees.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  now,  IBM  itself  was  coming  under  scrutiny  for  its  Nazi  connections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company  had  become  a  virtual  way  station  for  German  nationals  transit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  in  and  out  of  New  York  for  training,  meetings,  and  conferences.  Some  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">these  men  were  now  moving  with  the  vanguard  of  the  German  destruction </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  in  Austria,  Czechoslovakia,  Poland,  and  Holland.  Others  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  to  South  America.  A  number  of  German  nationals  were  actually </p>
<p class="calibre1">stationed at IBM offices in the United States. Some of them were openly anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitic  and  pro-Nazi.  To  even  express  pro-Nazi  opinions  was  now  consid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered  anti-American.64  Beyond  the  vaunted  publicity  stunts  and  symphonies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's Nazi alliance was quietly emerging from the haze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  end  of  May  1940,  FBI  Director  J.  Edgar  Hoover  became  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ested  in  IBM's  Nazi  connections.  Suspecting  the  company  of  hosting  a  hot- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bed  of  Nazi  agitation,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  in  late  May, </p>
<p class="calibre1">launched  wide-ranging  investigations  on  at  least  four  German  nationals </p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  by  IBM  and  suspected  of  espionage  or  other  subversive  conduct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although no charges were ever brought, more probes would follow and they </p>
<p class="calibre1">would continue for years. Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle became the </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Department's  point    man    fo r   espionage  concerns  at    IBM.  Berle  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoover  began  to  regularly  trade  information  on  the  suspected  spies  at  IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  short  order,  federal  agents  and  local  police  intelligence  officers  were  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">patched  to  IBM  offices  in  Manhattan,  Endicott,  Albany,  Cincinnati,  and  Mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">waukee </p>
<p class="calibre1">asking </p>
<p class="calibre1">probative </p>
<p class="calibre1">questions.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  the  FBI  interviewed  senior  company  executives  in  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  offices,  including  the  executive  secretary,  sales  manager,  education  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">partment  director,  and  even  Executive  Vice  President  and  General  Manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frederick  Nichol.  The  field  investigations  soon  came  to  the  door  of  several </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  clients.  Customers  were  asked  about  any  pro-Nazi  remarks  overheard </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  at  least  one  suspect  IBM  salesman  in  Milwaukee.  The  postmaster  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darien,  Connecticut,  was  asked  about  rumors  involving  a  leading  IBM  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nical editor, a German national working in New York who was said to be part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">an </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">society </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressing </p>
<p class="calibre1">pro-Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">feelings.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  soon  as  Watson  learned  of  the  FBI's  interest,  indeed  even  before  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  could  organize  its  investigations,  he  went  into  action.  Watson  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nichol  visited  Undersecretary  of  State  Sumner  Welles  on  June  6  to  volunteer </p>
<p class="calibre1">personal  details  about  potentially  suspect  IBM  employees  in  the  U.S.  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin America. Watson made it clear he would cooperate in any way, and take </p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate  steps  to  sever  corporate  relations  with  any  individual  the  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  thought  questionable,  including  several  specifically  discussed  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colombia  and  Mexico  City  offices.  Welles  referred  the  information  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">proffered to Berle, who in turn forwarded it on to J. Edgar Hoover. Ironi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cally,  when  Watson  and  Nichol  met  with  Welles  at  the  State  Department  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">June  6,  the  two  IBM  executives  forgot  to  mention  one  particular  salesman  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the name of Karl Georg Ruthe.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  FBI  soon  took  an  intense  interest  in  German-born  Ruthe  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  reports  of  his  rabidly  pro-Hitler  statements  while  in  IBM  offices  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  at  customer  sites.  One  widely  distributed  FBI  file  memo  related  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">comments  of  an  auditor  at  Blatz  Brewery  in  Milwaukee,  one  of  the  IBM  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tomers  Ruthe  had  visited.  A  Blatz  auditor  passed  on  Ruthe's  remarks  report- </p>
<p class="calibre1">edly expressing "strong sympathies for Germany and [the] thought that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  was  justified  in  everything  he  did,  inasmuch  as  Germany  was  given  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">very unfair deal in the last World War."68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  FBI  report  quoted  IBM's  Milwaukee  manager  reporting  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruthe  "was  quite  boastful  and  would  predict  the  outcome  of  the  batdes  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  taking  place  in  Europe,  and  that  he  kept  the  office  force  in  a  general  tur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">moil with his constant talk about Hitler and what he [Hitler] was going to do </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  European  nations."  Ruthe  was  also  rumored  in  FBI  files  to  be  a  mem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber of the Bund, an association of German-American Nazis.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few  could  understand  Ruthe's  continuing  position  in  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">since  he  was  hired  in  1936.  He  did  not  fit  the  IBM  mold.  Reported  in  FBI </p>
<p class="calibre1">files  as  a  "drunk"  and  "a  poor  salesman,"  Ruthe  was  said  to  have  seriously </p>
<p class="calibre1">under-performed  at  the  Endicott  sales  training  school.  Indeed,  when  Ruthe </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  transferred  from  the  New  York  office  to  IBM  Milwaukee,  his  superior </p>
<p class="calibre1">were asked to keep tabs on him.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Watson  and  Nichol  forgot  to  mention  Ruthe  during  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">June  6  discussion,  they  did  remember  several  days  later,  when  Nichol  sent  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  to  Welles  marked  "Stricdy  Confidential."  Nichol  wrote,  "In  the  discus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion  which  Mr.  Watson  and  I  had  with  you  on  Thursday  June  6,  we  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">looked  mentioning  the  name  of  Mr.  Karl  Georg  Ruthe.  The  facts  concerning </p>
<p class="calibre1">him  are  as  follows."  Nichol  then  listed  in  a  column  Ruthe's  date  and  place  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">birth  in  Germany,  graduating  school  in  Germany,  the  four  languages  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke, home address, and citizen status—which was "American Citizen."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nichol  added  some  other  background:  "Mr.  Ruthe  was  first  employed </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  us  on  December  1,  1936,  in  New  York  in  a  sales  capacity.  He  spent  three </p>
<p class="calibre1">months  at  our  school  at  Endicott,  N.Y.,  from  July  to  October  1937,  when  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  assigned  to  Milwaukee,  still  in  a  sales  capacity.  Prior  to  working  for  us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Ruthe  was  a  tutor  of  modern  languages  in  New  York  City;  had  his  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">school  in  Schenectady  (the  Schenectady  School  of  Languages)  and  was  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">instructor  of  German  at  Union  College  in  Schenectady.  We  understand  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  an  American  citizen,  and  believe  that  his  parents  reside  in  Germany.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  happens  that  we  saw  fit  to  ask  for  this  man's  resignation  last  week,  based </p>
<p class="calibre1">solely,  however,  on  his  inability  to  produce  a  record  as  a  salesman  in  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">business." Nichol included nothing more on Ruthe.72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  when  the  FBI  inquired  as  to  how  a  person  such  as  Ruthe </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  remain  at  IBM  so  long,  they  discovered  that  Watson  had  omitted  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">pertinent  details.  The  FBI  file  cited  observations  received  from  IBM  Sales </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manager  Fred  Farwell:  "Subject's  work  was  so  poor,"  an  FBI  report  recorded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that  he  would  have  never  been  allowed  to  finish  the  IBM  School  and  go  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  Field  as  a  salesman  had  it  not  been  for  his  close  relationship  to  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  President  of  IBM;  that  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Subject  had  been  a  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stant  source  of  trouble  to  all  men  in  administrative  positions  who  came  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">contact  with  Subject.  And  that  Subject  was  only  kept  as  an  employee  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">length  of  time,  in  view  of  his  relationship  to  the  President  of  the  Company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farwell added that Ruthe had married Watson's niece.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first week of June was a tense one for Watson. On June 3, 200 Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man planes dropped 1,060 explosive bombs and 61 incendiaries on Paris </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself. More than 97 buildings were struck, including two hospitals and ten </p>
<p class="calibre1">schools, killing 45. Ten children died at one demolished school alone. U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambassador to France William Bullitt himself narrowly missed death. While </p>
<p class="calibre1">he was lunching with the French Air Minister, a bomb crashed through the </p>
<p class="calibre1">roof and into the dining room, showering everyone with glass shards, but the </p>
<p class="calibre1">device failed to explode.74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  public  mood  was  reflected  in  a  page  one  story  in  the  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Times,  June  4,  reporting  a  mere  off-hand  comment  to  an  elevator  boy  by  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">German diplomat arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The diplomat asked if </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  young  man  could  speak  German.  When  the  youth  replied  that  he  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not,  the  diplomat  shot  back,  "Well,  you'd  better  learn  it,  you  are  going  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">need it."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On June 6, newspapers across the country, including the New York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Times,  reliably  reported  that  the  Gestapo  was  scouring  Amsterdam  armed </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  special  lists  of  the  "enemies  of  Germany."  Those  rounded  up  were  "liq- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uidated.  .  .  .  Nearly  all  have  faced  firing  squads,"  the  syndicated  articles </p>
<p class="calibre1">reported.  Rumors  that  the  names  and  addresses  of  all  Jews  living  in  Holland </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  already  been  turned  over  to  Nazi  agents  were  also  circulating  in  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  and  American  papers.  That  same  day,  some  2,000  German  tanks </p>
<p class="calibre1">began  rolling  toward  Paris  for  what  was  being  called  the  "Battle  of  France." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  bombers  hit  the  British  coasdine.  All  this  was  happening  on  the  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">day Watson was in Washington, D.C., assuring Undersecretary of State Welles </p>
<p class="calibre1">that IBM would rid itself of Nazi sympathizers.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  long  delayed  moment  had  come.  That  day,  June  6,  Watson  wrote  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">reluctant  letter  to  Adolf  Hitler.  This  one  would  not  be  misaddressed  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">undelivered.  This  one  would  be  sent  by  registered  mail  and  released  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspapers.  Watson  returned  the  medal  Hitler  had  personally  granted—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  chose  to  return  it  publicly  via  the  media.  The  letter  declared:  "the  present </p>
<p class="calibre1">policies  of  your  government  are  contrary  to  the  causes  for  which  I  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">working and for which I received the decoration."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Germany,  Watson's  action  would  be  considered  the  highest  form  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">insult to der Fuhrer at a moment of German glory. The public manner of Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's rejection only heightened the affront. This would change everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Berlin, at Dehomag, all hell broke loose. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the  tasks  that  the  German  economy  has  imposed  on  it,  par- </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  if  he  [Watson]  should  have  pretended  friendship  for  Germany </p>

<p class="calibre1">that  this  act  is  terribly  inane,  looking  at  it  from  a  purely  commercial </p>

<p class="calibre1">the  Fiihrer  of  the  German  people,  but  he  does  not  realize  that  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  only  be  one  result  of  this  act,  if  there  is  any  at  all,  namely,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Watson's personal economic interests can be affected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless  this  step  is  indicative  of  the  great  excitement  in  Amer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ica;  therefore  the  danger  that  America  may  enter  the  war  is  somewhat </p>
<p class="calibre1">closer.  If  this  should  happen  we  would  have  to  examine  the  possibility </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  separating  ourselves  from  [IBM]  America  in  view  of  the  new  condi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  Naturally  the  Economics  Ministry  will  examine  carefully  whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  receives  more  royalties  from  America  or  vice  versa....  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  welcome  it  if  the  royalty  agreement  between  Dehomag  and  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  dissolved  entirely.  One  could  assume  the  position  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">mutual  contributions  should  stop  with  an  exchange  of  patents.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  if  we  renounce  any  further  contributions  [from  IBM  NY], </p>
<p class="calibre1">no  royalties  should  have  to  be  paid  in  the  future.  The  IBM  interest  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Dehomag  would  then  have  to  be  transferred  into  German  hands  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  form  or  other....  Savings  of  royalties  could  be  paid  into  a  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">fund  and  at  a  future  time  the  rentals  could  be  lowered  to  correspond </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the present royalty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  any  case  I  have  the  feeling  that  Mr.  Watson  is  sawing  the  branch </p>
<p class="calibre1">on which he and his IBM are sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From Hermann Rottke1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The war was on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazism's  favorite  capitalist  had  fallen  from  the  Reich's  imagined  cloud </p>
<p class="calibre1">line.  By  returning  the  medal,  Watson  had  turned  on  der  Fuhrer,  insulted  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  people,  and  proved  that  IBM  was  no  longer  a  reliable  ally  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third  Reich.  Everywhere  among  the  insider  echelons  of  Nazidom  and  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man media, Watson's name was reviled. Hitler's personal paper, Volkischer </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beobachter,  declared  that  the  "vultures  of  profit  smell  the  fry,"  adding  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">regret,  "it  might  have  been  expected  that  .  .  .  Thomas  Watson  would  have  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">broader outlook than the hate-blinded Jewish editors and journalists."2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  castigation  was  not  limited  to  the  Greater  Reich,  but  was  broadcast </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  German  radio  and  newspapers  in  the  invaded  countries  as  well.  Quickly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  managers  in  occupied  Czechoslovakia,  Poland,  Norway,  and  other  Nazi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dominated  lands  learned  of  Watson's  affront.  They  felt  the  impact  immedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ately  as  their  German  customers,  corporate  and  government,  expressed </p>
<p class="calibre1">displeasure.  Fascists  in  other  Axis  countries  were  equally  offended.  Mus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">solini's  people  in  Rome  were  furious  with  Watson  Italiana,  summoning  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary's director to a formal reproach.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  suppressed  but  long  festering  resentment  at  Dehomag  now  coa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lesced into a unified list of grievances. Dehomag was a German company that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  stole.  IBM  NY  represented  foreign  domination  and  therefore  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  antithesis  of  National  Socialist  doctrine.  The  American  parent  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  charging  exorbitant  royalties  and  reaping  huge  profits,  thereby  exploit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  German  nation.  Most  of  all,  Heidinger  hated  Watson.  It  all  became  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">single impetus for open corporate rebellion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  backlash  was  immediate.  In  Dehomag's  Lichterfelde  office,  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  picture  was  removed  from  the  wall.  Stuttgart  employees  did  the  same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Hamburg,  Frankfurt,  and  Vienna  branches—and  ultimately  in  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  the  German  subsidiary's  offices—the  pictures  of  Watson  were  quickly </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken down.4 That was only the beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spurred  by  equal  parts  personal  greed  and  Nazi  fervor,  Heidinger  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke  began  scheming  to  completely  eliminate  IBM  NY's  influence  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  realm.  Step-by-step,  they  would  now  pressure  IBM  either  to  sell </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  subsidiary  to  German  nationals,  or  at  least  reduce  the  foreign  ownership </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  a  majority  to  a  minority.  Ousting  his  personal  representatives  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Berlin  subsidiary's  board  of  directors  would  also  end  Watson's  micro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">management  of  Dehomag  operations.  Plain  and  simple:  Heidinger,  Rottke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hummel  now  saw  Thomas  J.  Watson  and  IBM  NY  as  little  more  than  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign nemesis—a nemesis they were determined to cast off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  begin  his  putsch,  Heidinger  retreated  into  a  precise  reading  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  corporate  law.  On  July  1,  1940,  he  sent  a  registered  letter  to  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  convening  a  special  board  meeting  to  discuss  the  crisis  caused  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  insult  to  Hitler  and  to  expel  IBM  NY's  representative,  Geneva- </p>
<p class="calibre1">based John Holt, from the three-seat board.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using  charged  language,  the  meeting  agenda  declared  that  Holt  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be "eliminated" by a vote of the local board because he was an absentee </p>
<p class="calibre1">director  and  thereby  "prevented  from  fulfilling  his  obligations."  IBM  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sponded to the challenge with coolness. Geneva cabled a power of attorney to </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  local  representative,  Albert  Zimmermann,  authorizing  him  to  discuss  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">issue, of course, but then to vote IBM NY's majority against replacing Holt.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Insufficient,  declared  Heidinger.  Under  a  strict  reading  of  German  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate  law,  a  power  of  attorney  required  a  certain  sworn  written  form,  and  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorizing  cable  alone  was  legally  unacceptable.  On  July  15,  Heidinger  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vened  a  brief  sixty-minute  board  meeting,  disallowing  Zimmermann's  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">senting  proxy.  Then  the  two  resident  board  members,  Heidinger  and  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">brother-in-law,  Dr.  Gustav  Vogt,  voted  Holt  out.  "All  persons  present  agree </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  it  is  advisable  to  straighten  matters,"  the  rebellious  German  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved  by  "the  elimination  from  the  board  of  directors  of  Mr.  Holt.  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering  the  present  situation  ...  all  persons  present  propose  a  personality </p>
<p class="calibre1">[as  a  replacement]  who  is  also  esteemed  by  the  German  [authorities]."  Tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nically,  however,  with  Zimmermann's  proxy  disqualified,  a  voting  quorum </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  present.  Therefore,  while  Holt  could  be  voted  out  by  the  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">alone,  his  replacement  could  not  be  properly  voted  in  under  German  law </p>
<p class="calibre1">except  by  the  stockholders  themselves.  IBM  was  the  largest,  holding  85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing  Watson's  proclivity  for  hiring  lawyers  to  defend  hairsplitting </p>
<p class="calibre1">legal  positions,  Dehomag  adhered  to  the  explicit  letter  of  the  law.  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">sheduled  another  immediate  meeting,  just  two  weeks  later,  on  July  29,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">elect  the  "replacement  of  the  eliminated  member,  Mr.  Holt,"  as  the  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes  phrased  it.  Under  German  corporate  law,  the  minutes  noted,  if  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">declined  to  provide  a  proper  written  proxy  for  the  second  meeting,  then  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">token  minority  15  percent  ownership—that  is,  Heidinger,  Rottke,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel—could  vote  in  whomever  they  wished  to  replace  Holt.8  Doing  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">would neutralize Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  after  the  July  15  meeting  adjourned,  a  brusque  Dehomag  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  dispatched  to  IBM  Geneva.  Citing  German  law  and  company  statute </p>
<p class="calibre1">down  to  the  sub-paragraph,  Dehomag's  notice  advised  Geneva  that  its  previ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ous  cabled  proxy  to  Zimmermann  was  unacceptable  in  its  form.  With  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">without  the  approval  of  IBM  NY,  the  letter  blundy  warned,  the  re-scheduled </p>
<p class="calibre1">July  29  meeting  would  address  the  Watson  medal  crisis  "and  its  eventual </p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  for  our  company,"  as  well  as  the  "replacement  of  the  elimi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated member, Mr. Holt."9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  years,  cabled  instructions  from  Geneva  and  New  York  projecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  micro-management  had  been  routine  facts  of  corporate  life  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. But all that was before Watson returned the decoration. Now Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger had the momentum to work his own will. He would force his issues </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  combination    of  strict  legal    interpretation    and    rapid-fire  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">maneuvers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger's  July  15  correspondence  to  IBM  Geneva  warned  the  parent </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  that  should  it  fail  to  provide  the  proper  proxy  form  for  the  July  29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting,  or  fail  to  ratify  Berlin's  choice  for  a  new  board  member,  a  stalemate </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  prove  just  as  destructive.  Then,  "no  decisions  binding  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  be  taken,"  Heidinger  warned,  adding,  "To  enlighten  matters,  we  wish  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">state  that  according  to  ...  [German  corporate]  law,  the  board  of  directors  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  composed  of  three  persons  at  least."10  Holt's  ouster  left  only  two  sitting </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  members:  Heidinger  and  his  brother-in-law  Vogt.  Without  three  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  board,  the  firm  would  be  illegitimate  and  incapable  of  function- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing as a corporate entity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  ensure  that  Watson  could  not  litigate  the  board  putsch  as  setting </p>
<p class="calibre1">"unreasonable"  deadlines  in  view  of  difficult  wartime  circumstances,  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  scheduled  the  July  29  meeting  not  in  Dehomag's  Berlin  headquarters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  in  the  subsidiary's  Munich  branch.  Munich  was  much  closer  to  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  office,  "thus  diminishing  your  traveling  time,"  Heidinger  carefully </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote to IBM Geneva.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  time,  IBM  rushed  to  comply.  Watson's  Geneva  representatives  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  feel  comfortable  entering  Germany  with  officials  agitated.  But  they  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">present  their  resident  German  agent,  Zimmermann,  with  a  proper  power  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney.  The  July  29  board  meeting  in  Munich  convened  at  10  A.M.  with  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">reading  of  the  rules  and  relevant  statutes.  Quickly,  they  did  away  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional  balance  sheets  showing  losses  resulting  in  zero  bonuses.  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  forced  adoption  of  the  true  profits  totals:  nearly  RM  2.4  million  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938  and  almost  RM  4  million  for  1939.  Management  bonuses  of  nearly  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">400,000  were  approved  for  Rottke  and  Hummel.  Heidinger  reserved  his  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">bonus for later.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  medal  crisis  was  then  vigorously  debated  "in  view  of  the  great </p>
<p class="calibre1">urgency  of  this  question."  Heidinger  demanded  that  Holt's  seat  on  the  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  filled  not  by  one  German  director,  but  two.  He  nominated  Emil  Ziegler </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  suggestion  of  the  Berlin  Chamber  of  Commerce.  The  second  nomina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  was  a  leading  Nazi  official,  Ernst  Schulte-Strathaus,  a  key  advisor  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess' office.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  to  become  completely  Nazified.  The  hierarchy  had  plans </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Hollerith  machines  that  stretched  to  virtually  all  the  Reich's  most  urgent </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs,  from  the  conflict  in  Europe  to  Hitler's  war  against  European  Jewry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the plans were so sensitive they could not be discussed with out- </p>
<p class="calibre1">siders.  It  was  absolutely  essential  that  Dehomag  be  controlled  by  the  highest </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  party  and  government  circles.  Heidinger  had  connections  at  those  lev- </p>
<p class="calibre1">els, which had benefited Dehomag through the Hitler years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  had  been  a  friend  of  Hess'  since  their  soldiering  days  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  War  I.  The  Schulte-Strathaus  family  had,  in  1910,  helped  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">lauch  the  original  Hollerith  Company  in  Germany.  Bonds  remained  tight </p>
<p class="calibre1">durin g   the  post-War  years.  Ernst  Schulte-Strathaus  had  emerged  as  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  bizarre  and  mysterious  personalities  at  the  top  of  the  Nazi  leadership.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrinaire astrologer, Schulte-Strathaus read the stars for Hess.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  July  29  board  meeting,  Heidinger  demanded  that  Schulte- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strata u s   be  ratified.  In  fact,  Heidinger  had  already  invited  him  to  join  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  and  Schulte-Strathaus  had  already  accepted.15  So  he  expected  a  unan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">imous yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  was  not  ready  to  allow  Heidinger  to  dictate  who  could  sit </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  board—even  if  the  proposed  man  was  a  personal  advisor  to  Deputy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fuhrer  Hess.  Zimmermann  declared  that  he  was  instructed  to  vote  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schulte-Strathaus.  Wielding  IBM's  majority,  the  measure  was  defeated.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  preferred  either  Rottke  or  Hummel,  both  of  whom  owned  token  stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">options,  or  Zimmermann  himself.  Heidinger  staunchly  refused  to  even  allow </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  suggestions  to  be  voted,  asserting  that  German  corporate  law  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  ineligible  for  seats  on  a  board  of  directors.  Heidinger  insisted  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schulte-Strathaus as a representative of Hess.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  adjourned  the  meeting  in  a  stalemate.  Next,  he  decided  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">either  cash  out  of  the  company,  or  pressure  IBM  into  essentially  walking </p>
<p class="calibre1">away from its subsidiary. The stakes were immense for Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hess'  office  was  not  the  only  one  determined  to  ensure  the  complete </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  of  Dehomag.  Other  key  Party  advisors  to  der  Fuhrer's  office, </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  to  emerge,  also  had  plans  for  IBM's  equipment.  But  the  strategic </p>
<p class="calibre1">alliance  with  IBM  was  too  entrenched to  simply  switch  off.  Since the  birth  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich,  Germany  had  automated  virtually  its  entire  economy,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  most  government  operations  and  Nazi  Party  activities,  using  a  single </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology:  Hollerith.  Elaborate  data  operations  were  in  full  swing  every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  in  Germany  and  its  conquered  lands.  The  country  suddenly  discov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered its own vulnerable over-dependence on IBM machinery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millions  of  cards  each  week  were  needed  to  run  the  sorters.  Indeed,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  alone  employed  some  30,000  people  in  their  Hollerith  services. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adding  other  governmental  and  commercial  clients,  at  any  given  time,  thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands  of  operators  were  working  at  Holleriths.  Watson  presses  printed  all  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards these people needed moment to moment. IBM's paper and pulp supply </p>
<p class="calibre1">lines extended to mills throughout the world. IBM owned the patents for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">unique  paper  stock  the  Holleriths  required.  At  the  same  time,  Germany's  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">industry  suffered  from  a  chronic  paper  and  pulp  shortage  due  to  a  lack  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">supply  and  the  diversion  of  basic  pulping  ingredients  to  war  propellants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  four  specialized  paper  plants  in  Germany  could  even  produce  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  stock—all  were  on  contract  to  IBM.  The  few  paper  houses  in  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  running  low  on  coal  and  cellulose  supplies,  hence  their  deliveries  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">never  be  assured  for  more  than  a  month  or  two  at  a  time.  IBM  was  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">standy  pooling  its  global  paper  resources,  including  its  abundant  North </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  suppliers,  to  meet  the  ever-increasing  demand.  The  Reich  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  tap  into  the  vital  North  American  paper  markets.  Holleriths  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">function without IBM's unique paper. Watson controlled the paper.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Printing  cards  was  a  stop-start  process  that  under  optimal  conditions </p>
<p class="calibre1">yielded  65,000  cards  per  eight-hour  shift.  The  Third  Reich  consumed  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">at an almost fantastic rate.  In 1938,  more than 600 million per year were con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sumed  from  German  sources  alone.  In  1939,  that  number  almost  doubled  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.118  billion.  Projected  use  by  1943  was  1.5  billion  just  within  the  Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Building  a  printing  press  was  a  six-month  process  at  best,  much  longer  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  metals  were  not  available.  Dehomag  clients  typically  stockpiled  a  mere </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-day  supply  of  finished  punch  card  paper.  Holleriths  could  not  function </p>
<p class="calibre1">without cards. Watson controlled the cards.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Precision  maintenance  was  needed  monthly  on  the  sensitive  gears,  tum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">blers,  and  cogs  on  thousands  of  machines  that  syncopated  millions  of  times </p>
<p class="calibre1">each  week  throughout  Nazi  Europe.  Building  new  factories  might  take  six </p>
<p class="calibre1">months  to  a  year  just  for  the  first  machine  tools  to  arrive  from  specialized </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  tool  works.  Long  tool  manufacturing  lead  times  were  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed.  In  1937,  IBM  ordered  three  inclinable  power  presses  for  planned </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  expansion;  delivery  times  for  the  power  presses  required  ten  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">eleven  months.  Three  six-spindle  drill  presses  required  eight  to  twelve </p>
<p class="calibre1">months.  A  three-spindle  drill  required  sixteen  months.  A  radial  arm  drill </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  twelve  months.  Two  plain  milling  machines  and  a  vertical  miller </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  twenty-four  months.  Even  working  at  peak  capacity  in  tandem  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">recently  opened  IBM  factories  in  Germany,  Austria,  Italy,  and  France,  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">requests  for  sorters,  tabulators,  and  collators  were  back-ordered  twenty-four </p>
<p class="calibre1">months.  Hollerith  systems  could  not  function  without  machines  or  spare </p>
<p class="calibre1">parts. Watson controlled the machines and the spare parts.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  monopoly  could  be  replaced—but  it  would  take  years.  Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">if  the  Reich  confiscated  every  IBM  printing  plant  in  Nazi-dominated  Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and seized every machine, within months the cards and spare parts would </p>
<p class="calibre1">run  out.  The  whole  data  system  would  quickly  grind  to  a  halt.  As  it  stood  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">summer  1941,  the  IBM  enterprise  in  Nazi  Germany  was  hardly  a  stand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">alone  operation;  it  depended  upon  the  global  financial,  technical,  and  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terial  support  of  IBM    NY  and  i t s   seventy  worldwide  subsidiaries.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">controlled all of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  punch  card  technology,  Nazi  Germany  would  be  completely </p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable  of  even  a  fraction  of  the  automation  it  had  taken  for  granted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning  to  manual  methods  was  unthinkable.  The  Race  and  Settlement </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  of  the  SS  was  typical  of  those  Nazi  agencies  frustrated  over  their  long- </p>
<p class="calibre1">back-ordered  Holleriths.  The  Race  and  Setdement  Office  was  a  marginal </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  that  functioned  as  a  marriage-assistance  bureau  for  SS  officers,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore  did  not  merit  its own  Hollerith.  While  it  was  waiting,  Race  and  Set- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tlement  department  heads  complained  in  one  typical  statistical  report  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  office  simply  could  not  keep  up  with  its  prodigious  raceology  responsibil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ities without a punch card system. "At least 7,000 applicants," the report con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceded,  "who  fulfilled  the    [racial]    requirements  for  marriage  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting   years  for  their  Certificates  of  Approval  from  the  Reichsfuhrer-SS." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's  more,  50,000  additional  applicants  were  also  waiting  for  further  doc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">umentation  reviews,  the  report  continued,  and  more  than  100,000  applicants </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  only  been  provisionally  accepted  into  the  SS  until  the  office  could  prop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erly "complete their family trees back to 1800."20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  have  determined,"  wrote  the  SS  Race  and  Setdement  Office's  statisti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal  chief,  "that  the  Hollerith  punch  card  system,  which  is  being  used  success- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fully  by  the  Reich  Statistics  Office,  Reichsbahn,  Reichspost,  Reichsbank,  etc,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  various  research  facilities  . . .   is  necessary  and  would  serve  our  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ests best."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Race  and  Setdement  statistical  chief  succincdy  explained  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  difference  in  these  words:  "The  [manual]  way  in  which  the  files  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">[currently]  stored,  makes  any  quick  and  efficient  survey  impossible.  It  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">require  months  of  work  looking  through  individual  files  to  answer  even  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">[racial]  question."  He  added,  "For  every  single  one  of  the  additional  future </p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks,  months  of  tedious  clerical  work  would  be  necessary  just  to  determine </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  many  and  which  [racial]  petitions  are  involved.  The  punch  card  system </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  able  to  determine  this  easily,  quickly  to  the  desired  date....  There- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore,  card  indexing  is  indispensable."  The  SS  statistician  concluded  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">high  cost  of  the  IBM  equipment  was  justified  because  this  was  the  "exact </p>
<p class="calibre1">instrument  for  complete  surveillance  both  on  a  large  scale  and  down  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">smallest detail."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The SS Race and Settlement Office was finally allocated its Hollerith, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  only  in  1943,  two  and  a  half  years  after  inaugurating  the  collection  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage data it sought  to automate.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  punch  card  technology  so  vital  to  German  operations,  it  was  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">wonder  that  after  Watson  ostentatiously  returned  Hitler's  medal,  Reich  plan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ners  suddenly  worried  about  their  entire  Hollerith  infrastructure.  Ber l i n </p>
<p class="calibre1">launched  the  same  struggle  for  autarky,  that  is,  national  self-sufficiency, </p>
<p class="calibre1">already  underway  for  armaments  and  raw  materials,  such  as  rubber.  Out- </p>
<p class="calibre1">raged  Nazi  leaders  became  determined  to  replace  IBM  technology  with  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  system  they  could  control.  It  was  a  matter  of  Nazi  necessity.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">was a matter of Nazi pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  quiet  effort  began  in  France,  which  had  fallen  to  German  domina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  in  mid-June,  just  days  after  Watson  returned  the  medal.  Nazi  engineer </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Dehomag-trained  punch  card  specialists  from  Berlin  quickly  began </p>
<p class="calibre1">pilfering  the  machines  of  IBM's  French  subsidiary,  bringing  them  back  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  for  urgent  assignments.  No  longer  bound  to  honor  Watson  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  partner,  Reich  agents  categorized  the  machines  as  "war  booty"  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">could simply be seized.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next,  Hermann  Goering's  circle  purchased  a  majority  control  of  the  tiny </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers  operation  in  France,  hoping  to  merge  it  into  a  Germanized  cartel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  representatives  even  brought  in  for  examination  a  rival  machine  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  by  a  small  fledgling  French  company  called  Bull,  which  enjoyed  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">25  percent  of  the  fragmented  French  market.  Plans  were  already  underway  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase  a  majority  control  of  Bull,  which  had  wielded  no  mass  manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  operation  but  offered  a  replicable  design.  Watson  had  long  tried  to  neu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tralize  the  tiny  Bull  operation  with  patent  litigation,  buy-out  offers,  employee </p>
<p class="calibre1">raids,  and  even  outright  purchases  of  Bull's  operations  in  Switzerland.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull,  even  though  dwarfed  by  IBM,  still  had  a  number  of  machines  in  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. And its machinery was considered as good as any Hollerith.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Berlin  really  didn't  know  what  to  do.  They  stole  some  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  in  France,  purchased  control  of  a  Powers  subsidiary,  and  brought </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Bull  machines,  all  envisioning  a  new  cartel.  None  of  it  was  coordinated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but something had to be done to counteract Germany's dependence on IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  Reich's  point  of  view,  Watson  and  IBM  clearly  possessed  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">insider's  understanding  of  virtually  everything  Germany  did  and  indeed  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  its  advance  planning.  That  had  to  stop.  Argue  as  they  might,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  were  unable  to  convince  Nazi  officials  otherwise,  even  when  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  emphasized  that  only  non-American  IBM  employees  possessed  access </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  Reich's  most  sensitive  secrets.  Watson's  Berlin  attorney,  Heinrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert, offered a written opinion summing up the problem. "The military </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  are  greatly  concerned  with  the  whole  matter,"  wrote  Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">shortly  after  the  Dehomag  revolt  began.  "Not  only  are  most  military  agencies </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  offices  equipped  with  these  special  machines  but  the  authorities  are  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid  that  via  the  majority  of  IBM  in  the  Dehomag,  the  USA  [itself]  might </p>
<p class="calibre1">get  a  far-reaching  insight  into  the  activities  not  only  of  Dehomag  itself,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  of  the  big  German  rearmament  plants  and  the  German  economic  struc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ture  as  a  whole.  This  fear  is  based  on  the  particular  organization  of  the  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  of  Dehomag  and  is  not  quite  as  unfounded  as  it  might  appear  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">very beginning.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Dehomag does not sell its machines," Albert continued, "but lets </p>
<p class="calibre1">them out on lease. Before concluding a contract of lease, a thorough study of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the [client]   company,  or business  enterprise which wants to have the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines, is made from the point of view whether the use of the machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">fits into the system of the prospect, whether the use of them is advantageous, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and how the business must be organized to use the machines to the greatest </p>
<p class="calibre1">possible advantage. There can be no doubt that this method . . . secures to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Dehomag a contact and insight into the big business of the nation supe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rior to any other company."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert added that IBM's counterarguments and rationales were simply </p>
<p class="calibre1">not credible to the authorities. "It is no use to argue that this fear is </p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely theoretical and has no foundation [in fact] whatever in practice, as </p>
<p class="calibre1">not only no American citizen is employed in this part of the business ... [or </p>
<p class="calibre1">that] these studies are kept most confidential and secret according to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">strictest general rules and regulations. There the objection and the handicap </p>
<p class="calibre1">is and must be taken into consideration."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  IBM's  point  of  view,  the  struggle  to  create  an  alliance  with  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  had  been  too  great  and  the  potential  for  continuing  profits  too </p>
<p class="calibre1">rewarding  to  simply  walk  away.  Nor  would  Watson  tolerate  competitors— </p>
<p class="calibre1">existing  or  newly  created—invading  IBM's  hard  won  territory.  Since  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">dusty  horse-and-buggy  days  of  National  Cash  Register,  Watson  had  learned </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  to  compete,  but  to  eliminate  all  competition—no  matter  how  marginal— </p>
<p class="calibre1">by any pernicious tactics necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Geneva  troubleshooter,  P.  Taylor,  in  an  August  1940  letter  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  headquarters,  worried  openly  about  the  threat  should  the  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  develop  Bull  machines  or  an  ersatz  hybrid—even  though  it  would  take </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  to  switch.  "The  danger  of  this  is,  of  course,  that  the  Bull  machines  do </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly  the  same  as  Dehomag's,"  wrote  Taylor,  "whilst  also  having  alphabetic </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  printing  units,  and  [if  obtained]  they  can  easily  be  exchanged  to  replace </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag machines."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger had obtained a one-week travel permit and on August 15, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940,  he  visited  Taylorin  IBM's  Geneva    office  to    lodge    his    threats    and </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands. He was not subtle.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Foreign  partnerships  in  German  companies  are  not  very  much  liked," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  told  Taylor,  "particularly  where  the  foreign  interest  is  a  majority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  IBM  majority  in  the  Dehomag  was  not  very  helpful,  but  did  not  cause </p>
<p class="calibre1">too  much  harm—up  to  now.  The  situation  is  entirely  changed  by  the  step  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Watson  giving  back  his  German  decoration  and  writing  a  letter  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fuhrer  published  in  the  American  press.  That  step  is  considered  as  an  insult </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  highest  degree  not  only  to  Hitler,  but  to  each  individual  German. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  could  be  the  consequences?  Each  customer  or  prospect  will  try  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid  getting  punched  card  machines  from  a  company  which  proved  or  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">least  appears  to  be  hostile  to  Germany.  Therefore  an  already  existing  or  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">new-formed  German  company  taking  up  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  will  have  excellent  chances.  Dehomag's  business  would  no  longer </p>
<p class="calibre1">exist."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exaggerating  how  easy  it  would  be  for  any  new  competitor  to  emerge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  asserted,  "Patent  difficulties  do  not  exist  [and]  if  necessary  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  easy  to  get  a  compulsory  license  for  a  modest  royalty  of  say  five </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent  instead  of  twenty  five  percent  which  [now]  Dehomag  pays  [to  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">NY].  No  difficulties  would  exist  to  get  experts  for  such  a  system:  workmen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers, salesmen, managers."32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  threatened  to  call  for  a  vote  of  employees  as  loyal  Germans, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  they  would  continue  working  with  an  IBM  subsidiary  or  a  newly </p>
<p class="calibre1">formed  German  one.  "The  IBM  should  consider  what  result  a  vote  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  would  have,"  said  Heidinger  menacingly.  "Who  of  the  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  is  willing  to  continue  working  for  the  Dehomag  of  which  a  majority </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  owned  by  a  hostile  IBM  or  who  is  willing  to  work  for  a  new  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">company?"33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  more  complications.  All  the  open  undercurrents  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  as  an  American  business  with  German  management  were  now  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">firmed.  IBM's  subsidiary  had  been  unmasked  as  a  non-Aryan  business— </p>
<p class="calibre1">something  many  always  knew  but  begrudgingly  overlooked.  Now  many  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  were  preparing  for  the  day  when  the  U.S.  would  join  England  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich.  In  such  a  case,  explained  Heidinger,  Dehomag  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  enemy  property,  a  custodian  would  be  appointed  to  run  the  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  and  make  all  decisions.  "Such  [a]  trustee  would  be  the  only  manager," </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued  Heidinger,  "while  the  rights  of  the  old  managers  and  the  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">are suspended. The consequences would be disastrous. One of the several </p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities is.. . [that] the trustee would discover that our profit and there- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore the prices are too high. He certainly could and probably would reduce </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  once  the  prices.  There  would  practically  be  no  possibility  to  raise  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prices  again  in  normal  times.  Supposing  the  Dehomag  pulled  through  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">crisis—the return to shareholders could then only be very modest.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With  or  without  the  entry  of  the  U.S.A.  into  the  war,"  stressed  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger,  "the  danger  of  the  total  ruin  of  the  Dehomag  is  immediately  present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  member  of  the  board  of  directors  or  management  could  assume  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility of passively awaiting events."35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger offered IBM several ultimata. One: sell the entire subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  Germans  at  a  negotiated  price.  Two:  use  the  millions  of  surplus  profits </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Dehomag's  blocked  accounts  to  double  investment  in  the  subsidiary.  Issue </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  shares,  but  all  the  new  voting  rights  would  be  held  by  Germans,  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  managers  or  an  Aryan  committee.  IBM  would  still  retain  its  major- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity  ownership,  but  lose  its  control.  Three:  In  a  complicated  scheme,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">buys  out  some  of  the  captive  stock  held  by  Heidinger,  Rottke,  and  Hummel </p>
<p class="calibre1">and transfers that stock to employees.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever  Watson  decided,  insisted  Heidinger,  Dehomag  must  now  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed  to  exercise  further  control.  "The  advice  I  give  you  now  is  of  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">value than any advice given in the past," Heidinger told Taylor. But he would </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  wait  for  the  protracted  decision-making  process  Watson  was  known  for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  demanded  that  Taylor  cable  the  threats  and  options  to  Watson.  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">would wait in Geneva for an immediate response.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taylor cabled Heidinger's remarks to New York with his observation </p>
<p class="calibre1">that "a plan exists already for the formation of a new [rival] German com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany."38 Whatever Watson did now to enrich its local managers or relinquish </p>
<p class="calibre1">control, eventually IBM would be dethroned. At the same time, IBM people </p>
<p class="calibre1">understood it was far easier to talk about replacing IBM than to actually do </p>
<p class="calibre1">so. Harrison K. Chauncey, Watson's top emissary in Berlin, reported after one </p>
<p class="calibre1">key meeting with a ranking Nazi official, "We are threatened with possible </p>
<p class="calibre1">elimination of Dehomag through competition which may be sponsored by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the authorities." But he followed by countering, "The government at the pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent time needs our machines. The army is using them evidendy for every </p>
<p class="calibre1">conceivable  purpose."  He  added,  "During  the  war  it  would  be  very  difficult </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  competition  to  get  started,  unless  they  used  the  French  Bull  manufac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">turing plant." W. C. Lier, another senior IBM auditor negotiating in Berlin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">commented  on  the  prospect  of  Germany  not  allocating  raw  materials  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  manufactured  by  IBM's  subsidiary  in  occupied  France.  Lier  wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Chauncey, "the whole point is—who will manufacture since the Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  not  in  a  position  to  deliver  most  of  the  units  before  one  or  even  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">years?"  Lier  underlined  his  rhetorical  question,  adding,  "[who]  will  produce </p>
<p class="calibre1">the machines which are indispensable to the German war economy?"39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  1933,  Watson  had  refused  all  opportunities  to  restrain  or  disasso- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ciate  from  Dehomag,  or  even  reduce  IBM's  breakneck  expansion  program </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  Third  Reich.  Yet  now,  in  August  1940,  as  never  before,  Watson  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">confronted    with    one      genuine    last  chance—perhaps    the    most    decisive </p>
<p class="calibre1">chance—to walk away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  Watson  allowed  the  Reich—in  a  fit  of  rage  over  the  return  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">medal—to  oust  IBM  technologic  supremacy  in  Nazi  Germany,  and  if  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed  Berlin  to  embark  upon  its  own  ersatz  punch  card  industry,  Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">data  automation  program  might  speed  toward  self-destruction.  No  one  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">predict  how  drastically  every  Reich  undertaking  would  be  affected.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly,  the  blitz  IBM  attached  to  the  German  krieg  would  eventually  be  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracted  if  not  severely  lessened.  All  Watson  had  to  do  was  give  up  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  Nazis  demanded.  If  IBM  did  not  have  a  technologic  stranglehold  over </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  the  Nazis  would  not  be  negotiating,  they  would  simply  seize  what- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever they wanted. For Watson, it was a choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  instructed  IBM  General  Manager  F.  W  Nichol  to  telephone  Geneva </p>
<p class="calibre1">manager  P.  Taylor  on  August  19  and  enthusiastically  approve  the  ratification </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Hess'  staff  advisor  Schulte-Strathaus  and  German  businessman  Emil </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ziegler  as  new  board  members.  Watson  also  agreed  to  offer  former  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">counsel  in  New  York,  Otto  Kiep,  as  a  third  addition.  Watson  had  known  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">trusted  Kiep  as  a  family  friend  for  years;  Watson's  daughter  even  served  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">godmother  to  Kiep's  child.  Kiep  could  at  least  try  to  mitigate  further  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  efforts  to  exclude  IBM  NY  from  the  business  proceeds  and  help  shore </p>
<p class="calibre1">up  ties  to  the  government.  At  the  August  31  Dehomag  board  meeting  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin,  under  direct  instruction  from  the  New  York  office,  IBM's  representa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive  voted  with  Heidinger.  The  details  were  recorded  in  the  minutes.  "Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holt  is  barred  by  unanimous  vote.  Messers.  Kiep,  Schulte-Strathaus  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ziegler are elected unanimously."40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  would  not  detach  Dehomag  from  the  global  IBM  empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  would  not  allow  Bull  and  Powers  or  any  other  competitor  to  intrude </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  his  domain.  IBM  would  not  back  down  from  what  it  considered  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">rightful commercial place in Nazi Germany's New World Order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  coming  months,  Watson  would  fight  hour  to  hour,  deploying </p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyers,  special  emissaries,  and  government  intermediaries  to  protect  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">privileged and profitable position in Hitler's enterprise. Watson would not </p>
<p class="calibre1">allow IBM to be replaced. As a result, millions of cards, millions of lives, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">millions  of  dollars  would  now  intersect  at  the  whirring  stations  of  Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holleriths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">EVEN  THOUGH  Watson  had  agreed  to  director's  seats  for  three  influential </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis—Schulte-Strathaus,  Ziegler,  and  Kiep—it  just  wasn't  enough.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">pressure  on  IBM's  empire  would  not  subside.  On  August  20,  a  special  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mitee  of  some  undetermined  Nazi  authority  launched  an  investigation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  and  its  practices.  There  was  no  let-up  on  Heidinger's  insistence </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  IBM  relinquish  control  of  Dehomag  either  by  becoming  a  minority </p>
<p class="calibre1">owner  or  selling  outright.  If  that  was  not  possible,  he  wanted  his  now  valu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able shares purchased by IBM for dollars.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, the fact that Heidinger was insisting on both a buy-back of his </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares and transfer of the subsidiary ownership appeared to be a contradic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. If Heidinger wanted as much of the stock as possible in German hands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">why  insist  on  IBM  repurchasing  his  shares,  which  would  return  ownership  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York? But Watson soon understood: Heidinger was trying to cash out </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  position  in  dollars  even  while  he  helped  German  circles  dismantle  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  or  weave  the  firm's  resources  into  a  purely  German  cartel.  This  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming  all  too  apparent  to  Watson's  negotiators  as  they  explored  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">avenue to quiedy separate from Heidinger.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  late  August  1940,  Taylor  in  Geneva  suggested  New  York  might  want </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  simply  pay  off  Heidinger  with  an  enticing  financial  arrangement  by  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing  his  percentage  of  the  company  or  undertaking  a  one-time  buy-out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  some  or  all  of  his  shares  on  the  condition  that  he  cancel  his  special  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tract  altogether.  Knowing  Watson's  aversion  to  paying  actual  dollars,  Taylor </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested IBM trade "one of our buildings in Berlin," and add in more </p>
<p class="calibre1">accounting maneuvers. "If we have to pay in Reichsmarks," wrote Taylor, "get </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Heidinger  to  take  the  first  building  at  our  purchase  price  of  2,178,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">marks,  plus  the  difference  in  a  cash  payment,  such  cash  to  be  obtained  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  as  a  payment  on  account  of  their  indebtedness  to  us  for  royal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties."  To  keep  Heidinger  out  of  any  competitive  company,  Taylor  suggested </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  "would  continue  to  pay  40,000  marks  a  year  to  Heidinger  for  his  advi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sory  services,  and  in  the  event  of  his  death,  pay  it  to  his  widow  as  long  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">she lives."43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pages  and  pages  of  financial  and  political  analyses  shot  back  and  forth </p>
<p class="calibre1">between IBM offices in Berlin, Geneva, and New York. It was a constant state </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  corporate  crisis  as  the  vicissitudes  of  one  option  after  another  were  floated </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  sunk,  revived,  and  then  shunted.44  Through  it  all,  Heidinger  remained </p>
<p class="calibre1">adamant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  Berlin  attorney,  Heinrich  Albert,  was  one  of  Germany's  leading </p>
<p class="calibre1">experts  on  foreign  corporations  operating  in  the  Third  Reich.  Of  course,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  alone  in  its  lucrative  dealings  with  the  Third  Reich.  Many  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies  in  the  armament  financial,  and  service  arena  refused  to  walk  away </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  extraordinary  profits  obtainable  from  trading  with  a  pariah  s t a t e  </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  Nazi  Germany.  Indeed,  Watson  led  them  in  his  capacity  as  chairman </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  American  section  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce.  Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">counseled  many  of  these  American  companies  about  protecting  their  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries.  Based  on  his  experience,  Albert  sent  Watson  dozens  of  pages  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">dense  legal  opinions,  settlement  theories,  and  cautiously  parsed  recom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mendations.  But  much  of  it  built  on  one  of  his  earliest  observations:  "It  can- </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  be  denied  that  the  situation  is  serious,"  wrote  Albert.  "What  it  practically </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts  to  is  the  question  whether  the  IBM  prefers  to  hold  a  secure  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">safe  minority  interest  in  a  sound  and  safe  company,  [or]  .  .  .  the  holding  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">controlling, but endangered majority in an endangered company."45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  prevailing  view  among  many  was  that  Nazi  aggression  in  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  unstoppable  and  the  economy  that  would  soon  be  imposed  over  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  subjugated  Continent  would  flow  only  to  those  companies  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">favored.  Owning  even  a  minority  of  that  new  dominant  Dehomag  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">vasdy  more  valuable  than  the  Dehomag  IBM  owned  today.  Albert  empha- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sized  that  in  the  very  near future, "a  minority  of  shares  might  be  even  materi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  of  higher  value  than  the  present  majority."  He  added  that  the  notion  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">stockholder  "control"  was  actually  becoming  a  passe  notion  in  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">since  the  Reich  now  direcdy  or  indirectly  controlled  virtually  all  business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A  majority  of  shares,"  he  wrote  Watson,  "does  not  mean  as  much  as  it  used </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  .  .  .  [since]  a  corporation,  company,  enterprise  or  plant  manufacturing  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  is  so  firmly,  thoroughly  and  definitely  subjected  to  the  governmen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tal  rules  and  regulations."46  Clearly,  it  was  not  possible  to  continue  doing </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  as  a  German  company  without  becoming  a  virtual  extension  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich war economy. That had been the reality for years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  IBM  reduced  its  control  to  a  minority  or  retained  its  majority, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  appointed  any  number  of  influential  Nazis  to  its  board  or  management </p>
<p class="calibre1">staff,  was  immaterial  to  Germany's  perception  of  IBM's  subsidiary.  The  truth </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  now  known.  Dehomag  could  no  longer  continue  under  its  former  Aryan </p>
<p class="calibre1">guise.  "Neither  public  opinion  nor  the  authorities,"  assured  Albert,  "would </p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize the German character of the company [any longer]."47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson tried a number of compromises to redeem himself in German </p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes. None of them worked. He offered a sizable donation to the German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red Cross. Rottke immediately wrote a letter to Geneva stating that the gift </p>
<p class="calibre1">would never be accepted. Watson's hope that the furor would die down was </p>
<p class="calibre1">unrealistic. Although the decoration was returned on June 6, Nazis were still </p>
<p class="calibre1">roiling months later. German radio in neutral Sweden in mid-September </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared Watson persona non grata, assuring he would never again be per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mitted to set foot in any territory controlled by Germany.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson understood that unless he came to an accommodation with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany, Dehomag was only the beginning. IBM operated profitable Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag-dominated  subsidiaries  in  Italy,  Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  Holland,  Bel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gium,  Romania,  France,  Sweden,  and  indeed  almost  everywhere  in  Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of them could be targeted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At about 11 P.M. on September 30, 1940, Taylor in Geneva telephoned </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's New York headquarters with continuing reports  about pressure </p>
<p class="calibre1">against IBM subsidiaries in the wake of Watson returning his medal. Should </p>
<p class="calibre1">America enter the war, Taylor asserted, one of the first subsidiaries to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">placed under a German trustee would be Watson Norsk, the IBM operation </p>
<p class="calibre1">in occupied Norway. Earlier, Taylor's office had sent several letters explaining </p>
<p class="calibre1">how the seizure would work under just-espoused German military law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To allow the subsidiary to continue even after America might declare war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taylor now suggested creating the appearance that Watson Norsk had been </p>
<p class="calibre1">sold to Norwegians even though IBM NY would still own and control all </p>
<p class="calibre1">aspects of the firm. "We should consider whether now is not the time," Taylor </p>
<p class="calibre1">said, "to take the necessary action to make the company free from American </p>
<p class="calibre1">interests. We have come to the conclusion to suggest that the royalty set-up </p>
<p class="calibre1">should be considered, that the shareholders would be changed to avoid </p>
<p class="calibre1">American holders." As it stood, IBM's name was not now listed as controlling </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Norwegian firm. Norwegian records reflected four individuals as owners: </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM managers Holt and Milner, as well as two token Norwegians. But the </p>
<p class="calibre1">two Americans were clearly IBM Geneva employees known to Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Taylor offered a new list of reliable Norwegians to use as additional front </p>
<p class="calibre1">men. He emphasized, "The shares of these [new] people should be in their </p>
<p class="calibre1">name actually, and cash consideration given. Understood," he added, "they </p>
<p class="calibre1">would be held for the IBM—but no rights." The stock transfers could be </p>
<p class="calibre1">just a pen stroke away, he pointed out, because "the shares are in New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York now."49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's  more,  Taylor  recommended,  Watson  Norsk's  400,000  Krone </p>
<p class="calibre1">debt to IBM NY should be reduced on paper to further distance the sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary  from  American  control.    If  a  series  of    paper  transactions  involving </p>
<p class="calibre1">250,000  Krone  were  arranged  as  Taylor  outlined,  then  the  "estimated  loss  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940 is 75,000 Krone, plus a cash remittance in New York of 100,000 Krone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  deducting  all  those  from  the  IBM  account,  [it]  leaves  a  balance  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately 100,000 Krone, which we think would be in order."50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  European  empire,  primarily  vested  in  Dehomag,  appeared  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  managers  to  be  careening  toward  demise.  If  the  company  did  survive  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">challenges,  German  custodians  would  confiscate  it  as  enemy  property  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  as  America  joined  the  war.  Unlike  his  managers,  however,  "Watson  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not fear seizure by a German-appointed trustee. He actually preferred it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  peculiarity  of  German  law  demarcated  a  strong  distinction  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">the assets of racial inferiors such as Jews, Poles, Czechs, and other vanquished </p>
<p class="calibre1">groups,  and  the  property  of  what  in  the  bizarre  Nazi  mindset  constituted  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine  war  adversary,  such  as  Britain  and  the  United  States.  If  the  U.S.  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tered  the  war,  Germany  did  not  believe  it  would  occupy  American  territory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  defeat  the  country.  During  any  war,  Germany  expected  its  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprises  in  America  to  be  safeguarded,  managed  properly  by  a  trustee,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  returned  intact  when  the  conflict  ended.  In  that  same  spirit,  the  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  would  in  turn  safeguard,  manage  diligently,  and  return  American  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terprises.  Germany's  well-developed  alien  custody  laws  were  still  in  effect.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  while  Nazi  Germany  was  voraciously  plundering  and  pillaging  the  width </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  breadth  of  Europe,  a  profoundly  different  set  of  rules  would  apply  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM and other "enemy property" seized in any of those occupied countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  understood  the  ironic  benefits  of  German  enemy  trusteeship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  a  few  years  earlier,  he  fondly  remembered  his  own  experiences  in  a  let- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter  to  Hjalmar  Schacht,  president  of  the  Reichsbank.  "From  the  day  I  returned </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Germany  after  the  [first  world]  war"  wrote  Watson,  "to  find  my  company's </p>
<p class="calibre1">affairs  in  the  best  safekeeping  by  your  Alien  Property  Custodian,  well  admin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istered  and  conscientiously  managed  . . .   I  have  felt  a  deep  personal  concern </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  Germany's  fate  and  a  growing  attachment  to  the  many  Germans  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">whom I gained contact at home and abroad."52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taylor's  memos,  citing  military  decrees  regarding  the  potential  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">seizure,  explained  that  during  the  years  any  alien  corporation  was  under  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">receivership,  all  the  profits  would  be  safely  blocked  in  an  account.  "We  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sume,"  wrote Taylor  in a  mid-September  1940  letter,  "any  resulting  income  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  benefit  of  the  owner  in  enemy  territory  and  may  be  paid  over  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">end  of  the  hostilities  in  accordance  with  the  payment  of  enemy  debts  in  gen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eral."  Taylor  sent  exact  translations  of  the  law  to  New  York  for  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">study.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson queried attorney Albert. Albert confirmed that the rules of re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceivership had not changed.  In a detailed memo, Albert unambiguously </p>
<p class="calibre1">reported back: "A custodianship of the Alien Property Custodian would by </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself mean no special danger, as the law concerning the administration of </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy property, and the practice based on this law, are very conservative, </p>
<p class="calibre1">protect the property and keep it alive and in order."54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  potential  for  seizure  as  enemy  property  was  so  encourag- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing,  Albert  could  not  help  but  comment  that  Watson's  decision  on  caving  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Heidinger's  demands  was  actually  "all,  a  matter  of  [Watson's]  tempera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  of  taste,  of  general  business  policy,  of  the  outlook  into  the  future  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  on."  Watson  could  rely  on  Albert's  assessments.  Albert  himself  had  func- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tioned as a key custodian of enemy property during World War I. He had dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinguished  himself  as  a  keen  businessman  and  now  represented  those  same </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies  as  clients.  Enemy  receivers  in  Germany  and  other  Axis  countries </p>
<p class="calibre1">understood  the  potential  for  a  rewarding  business  relationship  when  hostili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  ended.  Ultimately,  the  Italian  enemy  property  custodian,  Giovanni  Fagi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oli,  actually  sent  personal  written  word  to  Watson  that  he  was  prepared  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">operate  the  Rome  subsidiary  profitably.  Fagioli  only  hoped  he  could  "coop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erate with the owners after the war."55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  IBM,  war  would  ironically  be  more  advantageous  than  existing </p>
<p class="calibre1">peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  current  state  of  affairs,  IBM's  assets  were  blocked  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  until  the  conflict  was  over.  Under  an  enemy  custodian,  those  same </p>
<p class="calibre1">marks would still be blocked—again until any war was over. As it stood, Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  was  threatening  daily  to  destroy  Dehomag  unless  IBM  sold  or  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  its  ownership;  and  he  was  demanding  to  cash  out  his  stock.  But  if  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  U.S.  broke  out,  Heidinger  and  the  other  managers  would  be  sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">marily  relieved  of  their  management  authority  since  technically  they  repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sented  IBM  NY.  A  government  custodian  chosen  on  the  basis  of  keen </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  skills—and  Albert  might  have  the  connections  to  select  a  reliable </p>
<p class="calibre1">one—would  be  appointed  to  replace  Heidinger  and  manage  Dehomag.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,  the  Nazi  receiver  would  diligendy  manage  all  of  IBM's  European  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries. The money would be waiting when the war was over.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  custodian  would  do  all  in  his  power  to  run  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">profitably,  he  would  also  serve  the  interests  of  the  Reich.57  The  custodian </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  make  the  hard  decisions,  probably  in  tandem  with  IBM  Geneva </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  there  were  nexus  subsidiaries  in  Sweden,  Switzerland,  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">real  or  nominal  neutrals  that  were  indispensable  to  Dehomag's  supply  lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other IBM subsidiaries in Latin America, Africa, and in the colonial lands of </p>
<p class="calibre1">conquered  European  nations  would  also  cooperate  with  Dehomag,  but  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  the  most  indirect  and  purely  legal  routes.  Plausible  deniability </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  real.  Questions—would  not  be  asked  by  IBM  NY.  Answers- </p>
<p class="calibre1">would not be given by IBMers in Europe or Reich officials.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  revealing  records  would  not  be  kept  in  New  York  but  in  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  they  could  never  be  uncovered  and  examined.  They  would  be  kept </p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad  in  filing  cabinets  in  subsidiary  offices.  Many  of  New  York's  records </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  pre-war  years  would  simply  be  destroyed.  No  one  would  ever  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">able  to  identify  exacdy  what  IBM  NY  did  and  did  not  know  about  the  use  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hitler  Holleriths,  or  how  many  IBMers  in  Europe  circuitously  shared </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  information  with  New  York.  Indeed,  a  war-time  Justice  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">investigator examining  IBM's  collusion  with  Nazi  Germany  wrote: "IBM  is in </p>
<p class="calibre1">a class with the Nazis." But the investigator was forced to conclude: "This is a </p>
<p class="calibre1">story told in circumstantial evidence."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  be  satisfied  with  not  knowing  the  specifics  held  by  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  subsidiaries  and  managers—so  long  as  those  subsidiaries  tena- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ciously  pressed  the  Nazi  regimes  for  proper  rent  payments  on  each  and  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine,  on  every  last  one  of  billions  of punch  cards,  on  every  spare  cog  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">plate,  and  on  all  maintenance  calls,  all  according  to  carefully  worded  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracts.  Those  demands  for  payment  would  start  with  the  machines  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">removed from Paris by Reich officers in August 1940.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  micro-management  of  the  most  infinitesimal  details  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">now  end.  That  power  would  be  delegated  to  trusted  senior  managers,  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agers  who  would  be  rewarded  for  their  most  loyal  and  most  difficult  service </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  generous  salaries,  and  then  anointed  with  great  promotions  in  the  pow- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erful  foreign  divisions  of  the  global  IBM  that  they  themselves  built.  Corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  security  for  these  men  would  be  seemingly  endless.  Even  their  children </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  find  lucrative  association  with  International  Business  Machines.  In  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company's literature, they would be remembered as "heroes."61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  corporate  haze  would  last  for  decades.  With  all  the  European  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mediaries,  ownership  nominees,  corporate  intrigues,  belligerent  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers,  and  Nazi  custodians,  it  would  be  impossible  to  reliably  point  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">finger  at  the  New  York  office.  Hollerith  machines  could  be  placed  in  muse- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ums  in  exhibits  tying  their  use  to  the  most  heinous  aspects  of  the  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich,  but  the  deniability  would  be  unshakable.  For,  in  truth,  from  1933 </p>
<p class="calibre1">until  the  summer  of  1940,  Watson  personally  micro-managed  virtually  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  decision.  From  August  1940,  IBM  NY  made  sure  it  did  not  know </p>
<p class="calibre1">most of the gruesome details of Hollerith use. It was better not to know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The company that lionized the word THINK now thought better of its </p>
<p class="calibre1">guiding mandate. Incriminating dealings with Nazis did surface from time to </p>
<p class="calibre1">time as   frustrated   war-besieged   subsidiary   managers   would   invariably </p>
<p class="calibre1">become too specific in the cables to New York. These communications were </p>
<p class="calibre1">discarded, however, and if necessary disowned by IBM NY.62 By placing </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself in the dark, IBM could forever truthfully declare it made millions dur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing the war without knowing the specifics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  emboldened  Watson  now  decided  more  than  ever  to  fight  back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  after  Taylor's  September  30  telephone  call  warning  of  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">receivership,  Watson  elected  to  confront  Heidinger  head  on.  To  do  so,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">would </p>
<p class="calibre1">need </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">strongest </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He </p>
<p class="calibre1">knew </p>
<p class="calibre1">who </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson contacted the U.S. State Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  HAD  BEEN  cultivating  contacts  at  the  State  Department  for  years,  start- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  at  the  top  with  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull,  and,  of  course,  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin D. Roosevelt. But entrenched influence was sought at all levels </p>
<p class="calibre1">down  to  the  lowliest  clerks  and  bureaucrats  in  the  Department's  technical </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices  and  overseas  installations.  Indeed,  it  was  these  people  who  rendered </p>
<p class="calibre1">the most service.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commercial  attaches  and  officers  in  the  Foreign  Service  were  supposed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  assist  U.S.  business  abroad.  That  has  always  been  their  charge.  But  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  widely  published  letters  of  greetings,  endorsements,  and  congratu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lations  from  Hull,  the  rank  and  file  of  the  Foreign  Service  soon  learned  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thoma s   J.  Watson  was  more  than  just  another  citizen,  and  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  Machines  more  than  just  another  American  company.  Increasingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">diplomats  and  Foreign  Service  staffers  became  only  too  eager  to  please  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm and its stellar leader. Eventually, Watson assumed the status of unofficial </p>
<p class="calibre1">ambassador-at-large,  or  perhaps  something  even  larger.  What  was  good  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  became  good  for  the  United  States.  The  protection  and  success  of  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  elevated  to  a  defined  "national  interest."  As  such,  IBM  subsidiaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">around  the  world  learned  to  use  American  embassies  and  consulates  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic partners in their routine business activities.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  special  relationship  started  in  earnest  in  late  1936.  Just  after  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  was  elected  president  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">managed  to  gain  unprecedented  levels  of  official  recognition  for  the  body </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  his  assumption  of  its  helm.  Ambassadors,  consuls  general,  and  attaches </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  invited  to  attend,  and  IBM  made  special  arrangements  for  their  passage </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  hotels.  Diplomats  and  other  State  Department  bureaucrats  were  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">welcome at the company's door or its lavish events. Watson traded on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">perception throughout the Department that he was a personal and influential </p>
<p class="calibre1">friend  of  Hull,  and  a  major  donor  to  Roosevelt.  Designating  who  would  rep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">resent  the  Department  at  a  Watson  event  was  frequently  a  process  handled </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  great  deliberation.  A  dozen  or  so  memos  might  circulate  back  and  forth </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  numerous  offices  and  bureaus  as  the  collective  decision  was  carefully </p>
<p class="calibre1">rendered.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  first,  rank  and  file  State  Department  officers  offered  simple  coopera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  For  example,  in  fall  1936,  the  third  secretary  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moscow  conferred  regularly  with  IBM's  office  there  about  Soviet  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  attempts  to  break  IBM's  monopoly.  Cooperation  was  a  two-way  street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  continuously  check  his  busy  travel  and  social  schedule  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  officials.  In  spring  1937,  various  letters  were  exchanged  between  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">White  House,  the  State  Department,  and  Watson  over  whether  he  should </p>
<p class="calibre1">extend  official  felicitations  to  the  French  government  at  a  commemoration </p>
<p class="calibre1">event.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Watson  had  received  the  medal  from  Hitler  at  the  1937  ICC </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  Congress,  junior  officials  at  the  State  Department  had  begun  advocat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  for  IBM's  unique  business  advantage.  In  particular,  helping  IBM  avoid  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">reduce  foreign  taxes  and  tariffs  was  a  continuing  effort.  For  example,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  1937,  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Paris  helped  IBM's  French  subsidiary  gain </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  better  tariff  rate.  Just  days  after  the  Paris  Embassy  helped  with  French  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">toms,  IBM  sought  similar  assistance  in  Czechoslovakia.  Tax  authorities  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prague  were  raising  IBM's  tariffs.  IBM's  Foreign  Division  wrote  to  the  Trade </p>
<p class="calibre1">Agreement  division  in  Washington,  D.C.,  asking  for  help  "to  induce  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Czech] government to revert to the former classification."67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  cases,  the  lower  echelons  of  America's  Foreign  Service  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">eager  to  curry  favor  when  they  succeeded  for  IBM.  In  Bucharest,  on  Septem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  28,  1938,  Legation  Secretary  Frederick  Hibbard  sent  report  543  entitled </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Assistance  Given  International  Business  Machines  Corporation,"  bragging, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.  Schotte  of  the  Geneva  office  thanked  a  member  of  my  staff  for  assis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance  given  the  company  about  a  year  ago.  He  stated  that  following  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">advice  of  the  Legation,  he  [Schotte]  had  been  able  to  prevent  a  tax  suit </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  the  Romanian  subsidiary  calling  for  the  payment  of  60  million  lei  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  taxes  and  fines....  This  item  should  be  added  to  the  list  of  accomplish- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments of the Legation."68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lavish  letters  of  praise  for  individual  ambassadors  or  their  attaches </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  often  sent  by  senior  IBM  executives  to  Hull  to  show  gratitude  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">reward their effort.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's almost regal movements in Europe were regularly followed </p>
<p class="calibre1">and reported with the utmost detail by American diplomats who were always </p>
<p class="calibre1">on hand. Watson's v i s i t  to Oslo was typical. The U.S. Embassy there quickly </p>
<p class="calibre1">reported  "in  quintuplicate"  that  "his  train  was  met  by  a  delegation  represent- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  local  membership  of  the  International  Chamber  and  by  the  Secretary </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Legation.  Shortly  after  reaching  the  Legation,  Mr.  Watson  received  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">press,  responding  to  questions  in  a  manner  which  evoked  considerable </p>
<p class="calibre1">favorable publicity in the newspapers."70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  seemed  to  be  no  limit  to  the  service  lower-echelon  State  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  staffers  were  willing  to  extend.  Indeed,  while  World  War  II  was  raging, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  Department  administrator  found  time  to  write  a  letter  to  Frances  Munos, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an IBM employee in New York, passing along a message from a family mem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  in  Santiago,  Chile,  "stating  that  she  desires  to  have  you  purchase  shoes </p>
<p class="calibre1">for her use."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  as  much  service  as  State  Department  lower-echelon  officers  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiastically  providing,  it  is  no  wonder  that  Watson  turned  to  America's </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  attache  in  Berlin,  Sam  Woods,  to  use  the  weight  of  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States  government  to  help  IBM  confront  Heidinger.  Woods  was  enamored </p>
<p class="calibre1">with Watson and only too glad to act as IBM's post-man, openly passing mes- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sages  across  the  Atlantic  through  diplomatic  pouch  and  coded  cable,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">providing clerical facilities within the embassy. More than that, Woods openly </p>
<p class="calibre1">draped  IBM's  negotiation  in  the  mantle  of  American  officialdom  that  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped would make the difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  2,  1940,  Watson  sent  a  five-page  letter  to  Heidinger's  home </p>
<p class="calibre1">passed  through  diplomatic  pouch.  Not  only  did  Watson  use  the  convenience </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  diplomatic  pouch,  he  took  the  unusual  step  of  ostentatiously  typing  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  top:  "Letter  to  be  transmitted  through  the  courtesy  of  the  State  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment to Mr. Willy Heidinger, Pocking 56, am Starnberger See, Bavaria, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  began  with  a  cooperative  tone.  He  confirmed,  "On  August  19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">last,  we  telephoned  our  Geneva  office  to  inform  you  that  we  would  be  glad </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  comply  with  your  request  for  the  election  of  Messrs.  Schulte-Strathaus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ziegler  and  Kiep  as  directors  of  Dehomag.  We  were  later  informed  that  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  duly  elected  ...  on  August  31,  1940."  He  went  on,  "It  has  always  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  desire  to  work  in  harmony  with  you  for  we  realize  how  valuable  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">association  with  us  has  been  .  .  .  we  maintain  the  highest  respect  for  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment."  He  added,  "We  thought  you  were  entirely  right  in  the  suggestions </p>
<p class="calibre1">you made about enlarging the Board of Directors and placing thereon </p>
<p class="calibre1">[three] men of affairs."73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Watson stressed, questions of Dehomag being threat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ened unless IBM relinquished its majority w a s  "a matter of such importance" </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  it  needed  to  "be  presented  to  our  fu l l   Board  of  Directors  [in  New  York] </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  all  the  facts  obtainable  for  its  careful  consideration."  He  added,  "You </p>
<p class="calibre1">must  realize  that  the  economic  conditions  in  the  world,  upset  as  they  are, </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  it  extremely  difficult  for  us  to  decide  prompdy  important  matters  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  you  have  suggested  with  respect  to  our  interests  in  Germany  without  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">all available facts and data."74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically,  IBM  NY  wanted  to  know  whether  there  was  genuinely  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt  to  undermine  Dehomag—privately  or  officially—in  favor  of  a  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">company,  unless  it  reduced  its  ownership  and  also  repurchased  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares.  Ironically,  as  a  savvy  businessman,  Watson  understood  the  deeper </p>
<p class="calibre1">fiscal  meaning  of  Heidinger's  actions  against  the  subsidiary.  Days  earlier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  confronted  Heidinger  with  a  completely  unexpected  scenario.  If </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  actually  endangered  because  of  Heidinger's  disloyal  actions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  the  division's  future  was  in  fact  worth  far  less.  As  such,  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares  were  dramatically  reduced  in  value  as  well.  In  other  words,  whatever </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  did  to  undermine  Dehomag  would  impact  the  very  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">share  value  he  was  hoping  to  parlay.  Heidinger  angrily  rejected  this  notion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  in  his  October  2  letter,  Watson  held  fast:  "We  do  not  acquiesce  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">statement  that  affairs  of  Dehomag  following  September  30th  have  no  bearing </p>
<p class="calibre1">on share purchases."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continuing  with  a  hard  line,  Watson  shocked  Heidinger  with  another </p>
<p class="calibre1">technicality.  During  the  last  round  of  corporate  fisticuffs  over  bonuses,  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">automatic  and  generous  buy-back  was  agreed  upon.  As  was  so  often  the  case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  the  negotiations  were  all  written  up,  IBM  preferred  at  the  last  minute </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  final  agreement  should  not  be  signed,  but  rather  oral.  At  the  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  reporting  a  continuous  multimillion-mark  income  stream.  Now </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  thought  that  when  his  shares  would  be  repurchased,  the  per  share </p>
<p class="calibre1">price  was  a  windfall  guaranteed  by  the  1939  oral  agreement.  Watson's  audi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors  had  calculated  these  shares  to  be  in  excess  of  RM  2.7  million  and  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  asserted  they  were  valued  at  RM  3.8  million.  If  compelled  to  pay  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">dollars  at  an  adverse  exchange  rate,  as  Heidinger  expected,  it  would  cost </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM millions.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  so,  declared  Watson  in  his  letter.  "You  [Heidinger]  say,  'Regarding </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  price  basis,  there  is  already  an  agreement  between  me  and  the  IBM.  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your  reference  to  an  agreement  .  .  .  evidently  refers  to  the  then  proposed </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement  with  Dehomag  for  the  purchase of  your  shares,  which  we, as  stock- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holders,  were  willing  at  that time  to  vote for....  You did  not  accept  or  execute </p>
<p class="calibre1">these contracts, and, in view of the fact that the proposed contracts were not </p>
<p class="calibre1">executed by you, of course none of their proposed provisions now apply."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, a year alter the contentious settlement was reached, IBM was </p>
<p class="calibre1">now saying that without a signature, it would not honor the agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The only binding contract that exists between us," concluded Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"is one executed in New York City on the 8th day of May, 1936 . . . [and] </p>
<p class="calibre1">executed in Berlin on the 10th day of June, 1936."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  assured  Watson,  negotiation  would  be  needed,  maybe  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  protracted  arbitration  process.  "Our  representative  will  meet  you  just  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon as he can secure the necessary documents to travel," he wrote.79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mindful  that  his  letter  was  being  presented  under  the  color  of  the  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  Watson  emphasized  to  Heidinger  and  to  any  colleagues  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi Party he might share it with: "Our respective countries are at peace with </p>
<p class="calibre1">each other, and we feel confident that there is no more desire on the part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  German  authorities  to  interfere  with  United  States  business  interests </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  there  is  a  desire  on  the  part  of  officials  in  the  United  States  to  interfere </p>
<p class="calibre1">with business interests of Germany located in this country. . . . We believe </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  our  two  countries  will  continue  to  deal  with  each  other  fairly  in  all  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness matters."80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  gambit  worked.  Heidinger  became  convinced  he  had  to  nego- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tiate. At stake was the viability of the German automation program. Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger could not make the decisions alone. He had been in touch with a </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret  source  in  the  Nazi  Party  who  was  familiar  with  Dehomag  and  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  uses  for  the  Reich,  and  was  willing  to  meet  with  Watson's  negotia- </p>
<p class="calibre1">for in Berlin.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On October 26, 1940, several cars motored to La Guardia Field. A dele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gation  of  senior  IBM  executives,  led  by  Watson  himself,  accompanied  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  man  upon  whom  rested  the  future  of  Dehomag  and,  in  fact,  IBM's  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  business.  The  vehicles  pulled  up  to  the  Pan  Am  terminal.  There </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  decorous  IBM  attorney  named  Harrison  K.  Chauncey  alighted,  ready  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">board Pan Am's Dixie Clipper to Portugal. A company notice for what was ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pected  to  be  protracted  travel  appeared  in  the  employee  newsletter.  The  item </p>
<p class="calibre1">was headlined: "Mr. Chauncey Leaves by Clipper on Trip to Europe for IBM." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  in  the  item  mentioned  visiting  Germany.  The  subhead  explained </p>
<p class="calibre1">only,  "Member  of  Legal  Staff to Visit  Switzerland,  Portugal  While  Abroad."82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  truth,  from  neutral  Lisbon,  Chauncey  would  make  his  way  to  wartime </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  for  face-to-face  negotiations  with  the  still  enraged  Nazis.  The  news- </p>
<p class="calibre1">papers  that  month  were  filled  with  terrifying  reports  that  would  have  intimi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dated  anyone  traveling  to  the  Third  Reich.  American  corporate  employees </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought to be Jewish were tortured in Romania under Gestapo instruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">British bombs hailed onto Berlin. Jews were entering the first phases of per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">secution  in  Nazi-dominated  Vichy  France  and  being  tragically  ghettoized  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">enslaved  elsewhere.  Moreover,  if  Roosevelt  declared  war,  no  one  could  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine the fate of Americans trapped in Nazi-controlled land.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  a  loyal  employee  for  thirteen  years,  beginning  in  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">controller's  office,  Chauncey  understood  little  about  the  innermost  affairs </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Dehomag  and  its  spreading  influence  with  other  IBM  subsidiaries.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn't  even  spell  newly  elected  board  member  Otto  Kiep's  name  correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  was  counting  on  him.  So  Chauncey  said  goodbye  to  his  wife  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted  Watson's    assignment.    Studious  and  reasoned  in  his  approach, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey's  briefcase  contained  his  own  private  plan  of  action,  labeled  "Pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gram."  The  ten-page  "Program"  bookishly  oudined  his  challenge  in  perfect </p>
<p class="calibre1">classroom-style  Roman  numeral  and  A-B-C  format,  step-by-step:  the  ques- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  he  would  ask  in  Berlin,  the  tactics  he  would  employ  with  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  with  their  various  financial  implications,  and  how  the  U.S.  Embassy </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  assist  him.  In  the  event  IBM  was  forced  to  arbitrate  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands,  for  instance,  he  planned  to  claim  the  business  was  over-valued </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  "the  amount  of  business  which  may  be  attributable  to  the  war  [also </p>
<p class="calibre1">means] the present profit rate is not a normal permanent profit rate."84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  some,  Chauncey  might  have  looked  like  a  schoolboy  in  a  dark  suit </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  tie.  He  offered  a  polished,  clean-shaven  face  with  wide  eyes,  and  ears </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  stuck  out  from  behind  nipped  sideburns  beneath  a  closely  cropped  hair- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cut.  But  he  was  a  sharp,  fiercely  tenacious  attorney  who  would  pursue  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">adversaries.  He  set  aside  qualms  about  flying  into  a  dangerous  Nazi  setting </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  was  completely  focused  on  his  historic  corporate  mission:  save  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe. For his efforts, Watson called him "the bravest man in IBM."85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY'S  PHYSICALLY  tiring  trip  to  Germany  via  Bermuda,  Lisbon,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  did  not  dampen  his  enthusiasm.  His  first  stop  was  Munich  where  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">spent  several  days  in  discussions  with  Heidinger.  At  first,  Chauncey  tried  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">reason  with  his  sometimes  emotional  adversary.  He  told  the  embittered </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag founder that Watson wanted him to stay on, not force the repurchase </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  his  shares.  Mostly,  he  hoped  Heidinger  would  help  Watson  comprehend </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  competitive  forces  that  might  be  arraying  against  IBM.  But  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  interested  in  compromise.  Chauncey  purchased  a  small  vase  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidingers  as  a  personal  gift  from  Watson.  Heidinger  refused  it.  Most  strik- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  Chauncey  was  Heidinger's  contradictory  arguments,  and  his  elaborate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and occasionally bizarre, air of secrecy.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  main  Nazi  objection,  however  was  made  clear:  IBM  NY,  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">proven disloyal, would discover the secret planned uses of the Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines. Chauncey and his fellow Berlin-based attorneys did everything </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  could  to  constantly  repeat  the  assurance  that  they  would  not  ask  ques- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  or  learn  details.  He told  Heidinger  he  was  willing  "to  go  to  any  officials </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  show  that  IBM  had  not  obtained  any  information  of  the  confidential  mat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters  being  done  by  Dehomag."87  Again,  IBM  NY  made  a  fine  distinction </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  what  its  headquarters  in  New  York  would  discover  and  the  day-to- </p>
<p class="calibre1">day knowledge its managers, engineers, and servicemen on site would be </p>
<p class="calibre1">required to know to do their job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A confusion of unwarranted alarms, false starts, and sudden rumors </p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounded  Chauncey  as  he  tried,  in  his  proper  legalistic  way,  to  make  sense </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  it  all.  But  after  a  few  days  of  treadmill  progress  in  Munich,  Rottke </p>
<p class="calibre1">telephoned  from  Berlin  with  something  that  appeared  concrete.  Rottke,  too, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  mysterious,  but  insisted  it  was  imperative  that  Chauncey  come  to  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">at once.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Chauncey  arrived  in  Berlin,  the  sudden  urgency  of  Rottke's  tele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">phone  call  dissipated  as  quickly  as  it  appeared.  As  was  so  often  the  case  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">wartime  Berlin,  whispers  and  hazy  conjecture  ruled  the  day.  Chauncey  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped for a meeting with an influential Nazi. But as yet, that was not happen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing.  So  Chauncey  immediately  sought  out  board  director  Otto  Kiep  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney  Albert  in  Berlin,  each  of  whom  offered  a  different  suggestion  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  next  move.  Chauncey  penciled  voluminous  notes  and  oudined  various </p>
<p class="calibre1">stratagems assessing the ifs and what-ifs of the predicament.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Chauncey  waited  to  meet  with  the  mysterious  Nazi  source,  he  lost </p>
<p class="calibre1">no  time  scheduling  a  conference  with  Manager  Karl  Hummel.  Hummel  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">generally  perceived  as  more  helpful  in  his  views  toward  IBM  because  of  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">warm,  personal  relationship  with  Watson.  This  would  be  Chauncey's  oppor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">t u n i t y   to  learn  firsthand  the  structure  of  Dehomag's  business  in  war-ravaged </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  conversation  with  Hummel  was  frank.  Acting  more  like  an  attorney </p>
<p class="calibre1">conducting  a  deposition,  Chauncey  first  tried  in  his  stiff  way  to  understand </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  emotional  Nazi  mindset,  why  the  medal's  return  was  so  threatening,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether Dehomag could weather the rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  When  did  you  first  observe  difficulties  .  .  .  and  what  form  did  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">take? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Sales resistance—before [the] war—because of [the] American </p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership. Prior to that some government departments would not do </p>
<p class="calibre1">business with us even if they needed the machines, because they claimed </p>
<p class="calibre1">[the] confidential nature of [the] department's activities prevented doing </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  with...  [an]  American  owned  concern.  War  caused  tremendous </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  in  those  departments  and  they  f i nal l y  decided  that  they  had  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  the  machines—but  treated  us  very  badly  because  of  American  own- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ership.  About  35  percent  of  [our]  business  ...  is  with  government  depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments.  [In  the  future,]  even  if  [a]  machine  made  in  Germany  is  not  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">good  at  first  as  ours,  the  government  will  take  the  German  machines  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">once  that  is  done  the  private  industries  will  follow.  All  of  those  industries </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  now  under  the  government  anyway,  and  only  a  suggestion  is  needed </p>
<p class="calibre1">for them to change over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  So  ...  the form  of  any  animosity  was  merely  growling  about  hav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  do  business  with  an  .  .  .  American-owned  concern?  Did  any  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cerns  actually  refuse  to  do  business  with  you  because  of  American  interest </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Dehomag? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  There  were  no  German  machines.  .  .  .  The  point.  .  .  [will  be]  quite </p>
<p class="calibre1">different  when  prospects  have  a  choice  between  German  machines  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  machines  .  .  .  prospects  kept  saying  that  they  would  prefer  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">wait for the German machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: After the war commenced, did the difficulties increase? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Sure!...  [But]  in  my  mind,  [a]  high  percentage  of  difficulties  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  away  because  our  people  kept  [the]  friendship  of  the  people!  [A] </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  companies  took  the  machines  but  did  not  like  it!  "We  don't </p>
<p class="calibre1">want American machines," they said, but [the] Government ordered them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Notwithstanding that the animosity existed against Dehomag? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  In  view  of  labor  conditions,  they  could  not  do  otherwise.  This  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  the  Government  realized  the  necessity  of  relying  upon  an  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  What  if  anything  did  you  report  to  IBM  when  this  difficulty  first </p>
<p class="calibre1">arose and increased after the commencement of the war? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  When  Schotte  was  here  the  difficulties  had  not  increased  so  much </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  we  did  not  think  . . .   it  was  so  very  much  worse  than  it  had  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  ...  we  always  had  been  accustomed  to  the  sales  resistance  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">we were American owned! 90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  turned  to  the  issue  of  Hitler's  medal.  Hummel  tried  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate  but  reflected  the  ire  of  many  Germans.  The  photos  of  Hitler  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  and  IBM's  rejected  letter  offering  a  German  Red  Cross  donation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were lying nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  When  did...  the  difficulty  reach  auch  a  point  that  you  thought </p>
<p class="calibre1">... something [had] to be done? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  When  Mr.  Watson  returned  the  medal.  It  came  like  a  bomb.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">man from the radio told us before anything [was] seen in the papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: IS it your feeling that this brought the thing to a climax, or was it </p>
<p class="calibre1">really  the  reaction  which  you  experienced  with  your  customers  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">prospects? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  excuse  Mr.  Watson  because  he  looked  at  it  from  his  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">viewpoint—but it hurt us. In Italy it was as bad as in Germany ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  But  let's  have  concrete  examples.  Was  it  merely  talk,  or  did  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tomers refuse to deal with you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  You  must  remember  that  the  Nazis,  when  they  feel  insulted,  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  certain  that  they  will  pay  back  that  injury.  It  shows  [how]  they  feel </p>
<p class="calibre1">when they refused the gift [of a Red Cross donation]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  SO  they  refer  to  the  return  of  the  decoration  when  they  refused </p>
<p class="calibre1">the gift? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  They  expressed  clearly  "we  do  not  want  anything  from  that  man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They said Watson and IBM's gift could not be accepted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Why  was  it  presented  as  a  gift  of  Mr.  Watson  and  not  of  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">[corporately]? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  They  identify  Watson  and  IBM  as  one  person,  just  like  you  cannot </p>
<p class="calibre1">divide Patterson and the National Cash Register Co. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: But Patterson owned the National Cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  But  the  letter  was  written  in  [such  a]  form  that  it  was  the  instruc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions from Mr. Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  IS  there  anydiing  I  could  do  to  correct  that  misunderstanding, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that it was IBM's gift and not Mr. Watson's? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Don't  try—they  will treat  you  politely  and  let  you  go,  because  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  say  or  think  that  you  cannot  pay  for  an  insult.  Here  is  the  letter  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">[IBM]  Geneva,  24  July,  saying  that  Mr.  Watson  had  instructed  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money be given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Did  you  present  it  as  a  gift  from  Mr.  Watson  or  as  a  gift  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  had  to  show  the  letter.  We  could  not  risk  saying  it  was  a  gift </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  IBM  without  having  something  to  show.  ...  It  is  personal  danger  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">us  ...  if  we  did  not  show  the  letter.  If  we  failed  to  show  the  letter  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  been  sent  to  the  concentration  camp.  We  had  to  take  all  of  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  pictures  down  because  of  the  visitors  or  officials  who  considered </p>
<p class="calibre1">that when Mr. Watson insulted Hitler he also insulted them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:      Then  when  did  you  decide  it  was  neccesary  to  give  up  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[stockholder] majority - only after t he return of the decoration? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Oh,  sure  ..  .  when  the  medal  was  returned  it  showed  that  [the]... </p>
<p class="calibre1">animosity  against  us  was  now  proved.  Do  not  worry  but  when  things  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">settled  they  have  their  intentions  to  reply  to  Mr.  Watson.  The  Americans </p>
<p class="calibre1">refused  to  give  Germany  cotton,  and  Hitler  said  we  will  make  cotton.  Now </p>
<p class="calibre1">we  have  cotton—and  rubber  and  all  the  other  things  they  wouldn't  let  us </p>
<p class="calibre1">have without dollars.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  turned  to  the  economic  outlook.  Was  Dehomag  worth  sav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing?  Could  it  be  saved?  Hummel  equivocated  from  moment  to  moment  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  prospects.  In  truth,  no  one  knew  in  this  fluid  wartime  situation  just  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  leaders  would  decide.  Would  they  choose  to  angrily  excise  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  proceed  with  a  dubious  patchwork  of  punch  card  systems  that  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  months  if  not  years  to  meet  the  Reich's  escalating  needs,  or  would  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">pragmatic modus vivendi be adopted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Then you are going to lose a lot of business after the war? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  I  think  .  .  .  Hitler  has  so  much  in  mind  now,  improvements,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  saw  in  the  paper  the  housing  plan!  We  feel  that  we  will  lose  that  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  if  German  competition  comes  up.  Otherwise  not.  Very  few  will  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">continue  machines  after  the  war—except  that  they  may  and  probably  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">change  our  machines  for  German  machines.  I  think  if  we  do  not  get  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man competition, our business will grow tremendously.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  When  did  you  first  learn  .  ..  that  a  new  German  company  should </p>
<p class="calibre1">be formed to compete with Dehomag? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:      There    are    dozens    of  people    who    have    discussed    that    and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  believes  he  knows  much  more.  People  say,  "We  will  build  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory—and  we  will  get  you."  Take  [the]  case  if  Goering  [Hitler's  second- </p>
<p class="calibre1">in-command]  buys  Bull  patents  and  gets  into  the  tabulating  business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What do you think would happen then? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  What  information  have  you  obtained  as  to  the  purchase  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers in Germany—I have heard now that it may not be Siemens? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  It  may  be  Goering—whenever  the  Government  feels that the  indus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">try  should  be  started,  it  will  put  it  in  Hermann  Goering  Works.  You  may  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  that  if  that  happens,  Dehomag  is  no  longer  in  business.  Look  at  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull  has  been  doing  in  France—they  claimed  that  you  tried  to  buy  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  but  that  they  would  not  sell  out  to  Americans.  Our  security  is—Rottke </p>
<p class="calibre1">['s] and mine—is continuing with IBM, because we would have great </p>
<p class="calibre1">difficulty  with  [any  new]  German  partners.  We  merely  think  in  our  hearts </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  we  must  show  you  t he  danger.  If  you  don't  act  on  it,  all  right!  We  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">attacked  and  attacked,  and  when  Mr.  Watson  got  the  decoration  it  helped </p>
<p class="calibre1">us.  We  have  a  picture  of  it—here—and  a  picture  of  Mr.  Watson  and  Hitler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  advertising  to  us.  When  we  wanted  something  we  could  show  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  say:  "You  can't  refuse."  With  officials  and  customers  it  was  a  good  sell- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing point, and when it was returned it had the opposite effect and worse.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  now  methodically  reviewed  for  himself  exacdy  what  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements Dehomag was engaged in throughout Europe, country by </p>
<p class="calibre1">country. At the time, IBM had devised complicated and often circuitous </p>
<p class="calibre1">methtods of payment that generally but not always followed a 75-25 percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">split of revenues between New York and Dehomag. IBM subsidiaries across </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe would generate orders for equipment, parts, and punch cards. Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  would  supply  these,  either  direcdy  or  through  the  subsidiaries  it  domi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated  in  Nazi-conquered  territory.  IBM  NY's  75  percent  share  of  the  money </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  sometimes  be  sent  to  Geneva,  and  sometimes  to  Berlin.  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  often—but  not  always—receive  its  25  percent  share  by  crediting  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">it owed IBM for spare parts, the so-called "goods account." But all these pay- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  procedures  were  frequently  modified—or  even  set  aside—as  conflict- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing country-by-country wartime regulations emerged.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  received  its  money  either  through  Geneva,  which  openly  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred  the  sums  to  New  York,  or  through  Dehomag,  which  blocked  the  rev- </p>
<p class="calibre1">enues  until  war's  end,  although  they  could  be  used  to  grow  the  subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  purchase  real  estate.94  Chauncey  now  wanted  to  make  sure  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">was still abiding by the payment procedures as much as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Have  you  ever  had  any  understanding  with  IBM  in  Geneva </p>
<p class="calibre1">about the classification of machines for royalties? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  feel  obliged  to  pay  on  sorters  and  tabulators. The  Devisenstelle </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Foreign  Exchange  Office]  will  not  permit  us  to  pay  royalties  on  other  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines.  Patents  on  the  sorters  will  soon  expire,  and  now  there  is  a  serious </p>
<p class="calibre1">question  whether  they  will  say  you  can't  pay  royalties  on  expired  patents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have to get all the license statements verified by the Government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Well, I intend to reserve all our rights ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Austria.  IBM  owes  Dehomag  nineteen  thousand  dollars.  That  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">five  or  six  years  ago.  .  .  .  You  agreed  . . .   to  pay  us  nineteen  thousand  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">cash.  But  you  never  paid  it  and  every  time  we  went  to  the  Finance  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment it made a serious problem for us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey:  Go  ahead  any  try  to  offset  what  you  say  is  held  in  Austria  for  us </p>
<p class="calibre1">against those items. Vienna Company? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel:  After  incorporation  of  Austria  in  Germany,  the  tax  people  claimed </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  [with]  the  existence  of  that  company  there,  that  IBM  had  business  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  and  thereby  [was]  subject  to  the  high  tax.  Every  opportunity  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  by  the  tax  authorities  to  fix  liability  on  IBM  for  that  higher  tax.  They </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  always  contended  that  Dehomag  is  an  "organ"  of  IBM  and  is  subject </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the tax.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Countries now incorporated into Germany? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Austria, Sudetenland, German Poland, Alsace-Lorraine, Silesia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Bohemia Moravia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: That is treated as a part of Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Poland? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Very  few  customers  left,  the  business  is  almost  destroyed.  Besides </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  are  using  all  the  rentals  to  pay  expenses  and  the  Government </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  soon  close  the  Company  because  they  will  not  let  it  continue  to  lose </p>
<p class="calibre1">money.  Dehn  [IBM's  Polish  subsidiary  manager]  says  he  can't  continue  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">do  business—all  the  industry  [is]  now  in  German  hands  and  they  won't </p>
<p class="calibre1">do business with a Watson company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Can Dehne come to Berlin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Have him come here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Bohemia-Moravia—last  month  [the]  frontier  [was]  given  up,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">since  that  time  they  have  to  buy  machines.  Geneva  can  no  longer  buy  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines  from  us  and  they  have  to  pay  100  percent  for  them.  It  is  more  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">less included in the German territory. Not included de jure, but de facto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Are  the  employees  there  still  the  employees  of  the  Prague </p>
<p class="calibre1">Company? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Silesia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  have  taken  over  Silesia,  which  belongs  to  Germany.  An </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangement was made with Schotte for that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: What happened to our machines there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Some  were  sent  to  Romania  and  some  to  Hungary.  Some  are  still </p>
<p class="calibre1">there.  Rental  on  IBM  machines  that  are  there  still  get  75  percent  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rentals—you have no expenses there and get 75 percent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Is the arrangement for Silesia in writing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Yes, a copy was sent to Geneva and agreed to by the Devisenstelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Danzig? </p>
<p class="calibre1">H U M M E L : Only one customer. There was an agreement between Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Geneva.  You  had  no  customers  there  as  that  was  always  serviced  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. The people there refused to do business with Poland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Sweden?  Are  you  furnishing  machines,  parts,  or  supplies  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sweden? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Yes, if Geneva gives us orders. To every country, if Geneva gives us </p>
<p class="calibre1">orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: HOW are you paid for them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  75  percent  from  the  country  [Sweden]  and  25  percent  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">goods account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: IS there any dollar liability there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Suppose  that  Sweden  should  block  its  money,  what  would  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">be the position? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  Then  you  would  not  get  permission  to  export  the  products  to  Swe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">den.  But.  .  .  there  is  a  clearing  agreement  between  Germany  and  Sweden </p>
<p class="calibre1">and there is no possibility that that would happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Norway? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Just the same as Sweden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Denmark? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Just the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  In  those  two  countries,  Norway  and  Denmark,  are  you  in  touch </p>
<p class="calibre1">with the IBM people there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Certainly, we furnish parts and so on to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: DO you bill Geneva or the local company? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  bill  Geneva  for  the  75  percent.  Sometimes  .  .  .  the  authorities </p>
<p class="calibre1">don't agree, then we have to bill 100 percent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Holland? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Same condition in Holland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Belgium? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Same condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: France? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  have  to  bill  direct  to  the  French  [IBM]  company  [in  occupied </p>
<p class="calibre1">France].  There  is  some  exchange  of  goods.  I  don't  think  under  present </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  we  can  bill  Geneva.  We  sent  them  in  exchange  against  parts  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabetic  machines.  ..  .  eight  kilos  of  paper.  They  .  ..  said  they  wanted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">buy  paper  and  we  did  not  want  to  mix  in  that  business.  They  buy  direct </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the German paper mill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Alsace-Lorraine. Have you taken over the territory? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel: No, we have been called once for service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Who called you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: The customers called on us only once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: [Un]occupied France? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: We have no contact with that part of the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: YOU have not furnished anything for that part of the country? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  No.  We  helped  [Roger]  Virgile  [director  of  CEC,  the  IBM  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary  in  France]  get  permission  to  go  to  both  parts.  This  territory  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken care of by Virgile himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: IS the factory in operation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: AS far as I know, a little bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Italy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  We  made  an  agreement  with  Geneva  with  consent  of  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  in  exchange  for  alphabetical  tabulators  which  we  received  from  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we  gave  four  used  American  multiplying  punches  .  .  .  the  first  are  deliv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered  and  the  second  will. . .   be  delivered  in  January.  He  [the  Italian  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ager]  is  in  great  need  for  these  machines.  We  pack  the  machines  and  send </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  back  to  Milan.  .  .  .  twelve  multipliers  equal  to  three  alphabetic  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines. He [is] still manufacturing but very limited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Romania? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL:  If Geneva  gives us an order for Romania, we will fill it [under the] </p>
<p class="calibre1">same  conditions,  75  percent  and  25  percent.  We  have  not  furnished  any  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania [direcdy]. Few machines sent from Silesia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: DO you have to get a separate permission for each time you send a </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: NO, we have a general permission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Bulgaria? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Same condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Have you furnished any machines? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: NO </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Yugoslavia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Nothing furnished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Would you be able to furnish machines? </p>
<p class="calibre1">HUMMEL: Yes, except for transportation.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  continued  pressing  Hummel  for  payment  details,  country  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">country.  Throughout,  when  referring  to  other  subsidiaries  in  Nazi-dominated </p>
<p class="calibre1">lands,  he  spoke  as  few  words  as  possible—often  speaking  no  more  than  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">name of the invaded country. Not once in the long questioning of Hummel </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  Chauncey  ever  ask  what  the  machines  were  being  used  for.  Nor  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel  offer  any  details.  In  dozens  of  pages  of  notes,  reports,  and  messages </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent  from  Chauncey  to  New  York  and  back,  the  question  never  came  up.  No </p>
<p class="calibre1">one wanted to discuss it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SECRECY,  CONFUSION,  and  crisis  continued  to  surround  Chauncey's  negotia- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  throughout  November  and  December  1940  as  he  and  IBM  attorneys  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  conferred  with  various  influential  personalities  in  the  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">community,  German  military,  and  Nazi  Party.  The  tension  was  building  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">some, including Chauncey, began fearing for their safety.96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  attorney  Albert  had  created  a  nine-page  legal  opinion  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">staunch  recommendations.  In  his  written  opinion,  Albert  openly  conceded </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  most  German  military  agencies  relied  upon  IBM  machinery,  and  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  was  rightly  worried  that  IBM  knew  the  details  of  secret  projects.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  fear,  Albert  later  wrote,  "is  not  quite  as  unfounded  as  it  might </p>
<p class="calibre1">appear,"  based  on  the  intimate  knowledge  Dehomag  engineers  required  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">crate  and  service  Hollerith  punch  card  systems.  He  added,  "It  is  no  use  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">argue  that  this  fear  is  absolutely  theoretical."  Nonetheless,  Albert  urged  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son to resist efforts to force IBM to relinquish its majority ownership.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  was  originally  going  to  cable  Albert's  supportive  opinion  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York, together with a six-page personal report. But at the last minute, he </p>
<p class="calibre1">retreated  to  the  Embassy,  "for  my  own  protection,"  where  he  typed  his  letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  is  important,"  warned  Chauncey,  "that  any  reply  you  send  me  be  sent  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">code  and  no  reference  made  to  this  communication  whatsoever."  He  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  he  had  shared  its  contents  with  no  one  except  the  Embassy  staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy  people  in  turn  made  copies  for  review  by  senior  officials  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Department  in  Washington,  D.C.,  before  they  in  turn  delivered  the  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">respondence to IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert's  nine-page  opinion  itself  was  undated.  Chauncey  was  to  destroy </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  after  reading.  But  with  the  assistance  of  the  Embassy,  Chauncey  elected  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">send  it  to  Watson  anyway,  by  diplomatic  courier,  writing,  "Dr.  Albert's  [opin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ion]  is  contained  in  the  enclosed  memorandum,  which  I  am  sending  to  you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">notwithstanding  that  I  am  supposed  to  return  it  to  him  for  destruction." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  enclosing  it,  Chauncey,  for  extra  measure,  removed  the  first  page  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  opinion,  which  undoubtedly  included  identifying  letterhead  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert's  law  office.  Chauncey  shared  his  worry:  "Our  people  must  report </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  conversations  with  me,  and  in  some  respects  they  may  be  under  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">instruction of the military authorities."98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  writing  from  the  security  of  the  Embassy,  Chauncey's  own  report </p>
<p class="calibre1">freely  outlined  what  was  at  stake  for  I B M   NY  in  retaining  its  strategic </p>
<p class="calibre1">alliance  with  Nazi  Germany.  He  described  the  vast  financial  promise  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third  Reich  where  "plans  are  laid  for  the  great  economic  future  of  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  creeds  here  is  'Europe  for  Europeans,'  and  this  probably  means </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Europe for Germans.'"99 </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  report  to  IBM  NY  continued,  "Naturally  everyone  here  has  no  doubt </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  how  the  war  will  end,  and  they  build  on  that.  .  .  .  consequently,  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">vision  Dehomag  doing  business  everywhere  in  Europe,  and  under  the  guid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ance  of  the  new  economic  order  in  Europe,  Dehomag  would  grow  tremen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dously  because  all  countries  would  use  machines  as  Germany  now  does....  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose  they  [are]  right."  Chauncey  added  the  converse:  even  "if  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">loses  the  war,  [and]  these  things  will  not  come  into  being  .  .  .  American- </p>
<p class="calibre1">owned companies could probably resume business as theretofore."100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  Chauncey  contended,  the  Nazis  now  understood  that  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  was  vital  to  their  war  aims  and  too  entrenched  to  be  discarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Replacing  Holleriths,  he  argued,  would  be a long,  difficult task  in  view  of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">military's  "large  use  of  Dehomag  machines."  Indeed,  despite  all  "the  animos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity,"  Chauncey  wrote,  "the  business  has,  however,  gone  forward  .  .  .  due  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the need of the authorities."101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  Germany  had  already  thought  better  of  its  first  hostile  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  reaction  and  was  trying  now  to  find  some  rapprochement  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Corporation.  As  for  the  machines  snatched  by  the  Nazis  in  France, </p>
<p class="calibre1">noted  Chauncey,  "I  understand  .  .  .  rental  is  being  paid  for  them  to  our </p>
<p class="calibre1">French company."102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  should  rely  on  its  decided  technologic  edge,  suggested  Chauncey, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  the  profound  difficulty  in  starting  a  punch  card  industry  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">scratch,  especially  if  New  York  could  block  French Bull  competition.  In  spite </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the quality of its devices, French Bull was a very small company with very </p>
<p class="calibre1">few  machines.  Bull's  one  small  factory  could  never  supply  the  Reich's  conti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nental  needs.  Ramping  up  for  volume  production—even  if  based  within  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull  factory—would  take  months.  Hitler  didn't  have  months  in  his  hour-to- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hour  struggle  to  dominate  Europe.  In  a  section  entided  "Length  of  Time  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Competition  to  Come  in  Actuality,"  Chauncey  argued,  "Unless  the  authori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties,  or  the  new  company,  operate  in  the  meantime  from  the  French  Bull  fac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tory,  it  would  appear  that  much  time  may  elapse  before  such  new  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">[could] ... furnish machines in Germany."103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watson,  in  fact,  was  ready  to  continue  fighting  to  keep  Bull  out  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi market. IBM had already preemptively acquired Swiss Bull's patent </p>
<p class="calibre1">rights in Switzerland and was preparing to litigate to block the French sister </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation from functioning. I B M  had concluded Bull infringed several </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM-owned patents, now that IBM NY had acquired Swiss Bull, which </p>
<p class="calibre1">legally controlled French Bull's patents. Moreover, IBM believed that French </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull's use of an 80-column punch card violated IBM patents and could be </p>
<p class="calibre1">swiftly enjoined by court action. So Chauncey added his prediction that even </p>
<p class="calibre1">if French Bull did attempt to cooperate with the Nazis, there would be a </p>
<p class="calibre1">great "length of time and difficulties for actual competition" to appear.104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  that  in  spite  of  its  autarkic  impulses  and  collective  rage </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  Watson,  the  cold  fact  remained:  Nazi  Germany  needed  punch  cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  needed  them  not  next  month  or  even  next  week.  It  needed  them  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">hour of every day in every place. Only IBM could provide them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My inclination is to fight," Chauncey declared straight out. But the </p>
<p class="calibre1">battle would be difficult. He knew that IBM was fighting a two-front psycho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">economic war: Heidinger's demand to cash in his stock, and Nazi Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands to take over the subsidiary. Clearly, the two were organically linked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but Chauncey could not be sure how.105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they bickered, war and invasion proved it was still good business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By now,  Dehomag's  profits  had  mushroomed  even more  rapidly than </p>
<p class="calibre1">expected, especially as a result of the Nazi takeovers of Belgium, Poland, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">France. As the Reich expanded its voracious need for Holleriths in occupied </p>
<p class="calibre1">lands, Dehomag's value was catapulting daily. The latest valuation of Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger's 10 percent stock, Chauncey advised, was now as much as RM 23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">mi l l i on—IBM accountants in Germany had already confirmed it. The new </p>
<p class="calibre1">figure was as much as ten times higher than calculated just a few months </p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier. It would be an enormous amount of money if payable in dollars— </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps $5 or $6 million. Chauncey expected Heidinger to prevail in any </p>
<p class="calibre1">court, should the Germans press his claim for repurchase. IBM's multi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">million-mark blocked accounts in Berlin would be seized by the court to </p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase those high-priced  dollars,  Chauncey warned.  For this  reason, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey was continuously trying to finesse a settlement. "I am after him </p>
<p class="calibre1">every day," he wrote.106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for IBM's fight with the Nazi Party, Chauncey reiterated his willing- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness to "make any representations to the authorities that our managers need </p>
<p class="calibre1">not reveal any information of the activities of Dehomag's customers... . but I </p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot get the actual persons out in the open."107 That chance would now </p>
<p class="calibre1">come. After weeks of remaining in the background, Dr. Edmund Veesen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mayer would finally come forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though Edmund Veesenmayer lived at August Strasse 12 in Lichterfelde, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just around the corner from Dehomag's Berlin headquarters,   h e   h a d   declined  </p>
<p class="calibre1">to make  his  presence k n o w n   to Chauncey until the first days of December </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940. Veesenmayer was one of Berlin's quiet but powerful Nazis, often feared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who helped to directly implement the most dramatic phases of Hitler's plans for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe and the Jews. He was just a step or two removed from der Fuhrer, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  from  time  to  time  summoned  for  consultations  by  Hitler  personally—a </p>
<p class="calibre1">claim  few  would  dare  make,  but  a  claim  that  was  nonetheless  quite  correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Veesenmayer  proudly  wore  the  full  uniform  and  regalia  of  his  SS </p>
<p class="calibre1">rank, he avoided noisy street riots and ghetto roundups in favor of boardrooms </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  embassies.  Always  lurking  in  the  shadows  as  Eastern  Europe's  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">heinous actions erupted, Veesenmayer was Hitler's most trenchant facilitator.108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born  Catholic  in  1904  in  the  town  of  Bad  Kissingen,  amid  the  pastoral </p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling  hills  and  lush  forests  of  Bavaria,  Veesenmayer  quickly  took  to  political </p>
<p class="calibre1">economics.  He  became  a  professor  of  economics  and  business  administration </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  Technical  College  in  Munich.  Veesenmayer  joined  the  NSDAP  early,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1932,  when  he  was  only  twenty-eight  years  old.  When  National  Socialism </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  to  power  in  1933,  he  became  the  personal  secretary  and  economic </p>
<p class="calibre1">advisor  to  Wilhelm  Keppler,  Hitler's  personal  economic  advisor.  As  such, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keppler  functioned  as  Veesenmayer's  direct  connection  to  the  Fuhrer  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">most powerful officials in Germany.109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keppler  was  not  only  Hitler's  personal  economic  advisor,  he  was  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  main  nexus  to  American  business.  Dubbed  "a  Kodak  Man"  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  military  intelligence  reports  for  his  links  to  the  Eastman  Kodak  film </p>
<p class="calibre1">company,  Keppler  owed  much  to  the  Kodak  Company.  Before  the  rise  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler,  Keppler  enjoyed  managerial  positions  with  several  firms  that  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  photographic  gelatins,  including  one  that  exported  heavily  to  Eastman </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kodak  in  America  and  Kodak  Limited  in  England.  Kodak  financed  50  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent  of  Keppler's  Odin  Company,  which  specialized  in  photo  gels.  Once </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  came  to  power,  Keppler  advised  a  number  of  American  companies  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">terminating  their  Jewish  employees.  He  maintained  good  relations  with  exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utives  connected  to  such  companies  as  International  Telephone  and  Tele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">graph  and  National  Cash  Register,  and  was  Hitler's  intermediary  to  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial giants as General Motors.110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Largely </p>
<p class="calibre1">through </p>
<p class="calibre1">his </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keppler </p>
<p class="calibre1">connections, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer </p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually </p>
<p class="calibre1">joined  the  board  of  directors  of  the  German  subsidiaries  of  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telephone  and  Telegraph  and  Standard  Oil.111  Veesenmayer  traveled  in  exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utive circles and spoke the language of big business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Veesenmayer  was  more  than  just  a  corporate  liai son.  He  was  arguably </p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  Reich  Foreign  Mini st er   von  Ribbentrop's  most  important  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">troubleshooter and advance man. A technical expert on the eradica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of Jewish communities, Veesenmayer was invaluable as a behind-the- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scenes organizer in Hitler's war against the Jews. As such, he had a keen </p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciation for statistics and Hollerith capabilities. U.S. military intelligence </p>
<p class="calibre1">described his meteoric ascent within the Reich's anti-Jewish destruction </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine as "an amazing career which took him on missions to Southeastern </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe always, it would seem, at a moment of trouble."112 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  months  leading  up  to  the  March  1938  Anschluss  with  Austria, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  functioned  as  the  Foreign  Office's  principal  economic  expert </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Vienna.  The  day  before  Austria  was  taken  over,  March  12,  Veesenmayer </p>
<p class="calibre1">shuttled  Himmler  from  a  Vienna  airfield  to  the  German  Embassy  to  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">form  a  new  Austrian  Nazi  regime.  The  next  day,  however,  before  the  puppet </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austrian  government  could  be  installed,  Hitler  annexed  the  country </p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether.113 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A year later, in early March 1939, Veesenmayer traveled to Bratislava to </p>
<p class="calibre1">help engineer the destruction of Czechoslovakia and the declaration of a </p>
<p class="calibre1">puppet state in Slovakia. On about March 11, he drove two handpicked Slo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vak leaders to Vienna where they met Keppler and then flew on to Berlin for </p>
<p class="calibre1">a meeting with Hitler. On that same day, Veesenmayer wired the Foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office, "alle Juden in der Hand," that is, "all Jews in hand." He remained in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bratislava  on  March  15  while  Czechoslovakia  was  dismantled.  Jews  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly identified in the days to come.114 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer was a frequent liaison to foreign militant movements. In </p>
<p class="calibre1">early 1940, he was assigned to coordinate with two members of the Irish </p>
<p class="calibre1">Republican Army visiting Berlin. Later, in Rome, he met with the virulent </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-Semites  Amin  Husseini,  the  Grand  Mufti  of  Jerusalem,  and  Rashid  Ali </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gailani,  former  Iraqi  premier.  He  escorted  both  men  to  Berlin  for  meetings </p>
<p class="calibre1">with Hitler.115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  Veesenmayer,  who,  in  April  1941,  brokered  a  written  political </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement  between  Yugoslavian  Fascists  and  a  murderous  Croatian  militia </p>
<p class="calibre1">known  as  the  Ustashi,  helping  the  Croats  remain  in  power  as  Nazi  surrogates </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  support  of  the  German  Foreign  Office.  Indeed,  the  same  day  he  bro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">kered  the  Ustashi  pact,  Germany  invaded  Zagreb.  Ustashi  militias  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed  free  rein  under  Veesenmayer's  eye.  It  was  Veesenmayer's  job  to  liai- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  with  Ustashi  leader,  Ante  Pavelich.  In  the  annals  of  wartime  savagery </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  the  Jews,  there  was  no  group  as  sadistic  as  the  Croatian  Ustashi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using chainsaws, axes, knives, and rocks, frenzied Swastika-bedecked Ustashi </p>
<p class="calibre1">brutally  murdered    thousands  of  Jews  at  a  time.    Ustashi    leaders  openly </p>
<p class="calibre1">paraded  about  Zagreb  with  necklaces  comprised  of  Jewish  tongues  and  eye- </p>
<p class="calibre1">balls  cut  and  gouged  from  women  and  children,  many  of  them  raped  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  dismembered  or  decapitated.  Pavelich  himself  was  fond  of  offering </p>
<p class="calibre1">wicker baskets of Jewish eyeballs as gifts to his diplomatic visitors.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  first  days  of  December  1940,  just  after  completing  his  assign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  with  the  Irish  Republican  Army  and  four  months  before  leaving  for  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">behind-the-scenes  work  with  the  Ustashi,  Veesenmayer  telephoned  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  and  Albert  to  make  the  Reich's  views  on  Dehomag  known.  Then  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">met with Chauncey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH DR. VEESENMAYER </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey in Berlin to IBM New York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Veesenmayer  is  the  right  hand  man  of  Dr.  Keppler.  Dr.  Keppler,  I  am </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed,  is  and  has  been  Hitler's  personal  economic  advisor.  The  organiza- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  which  Dr.  Keppler  is  the  head  is  a  Nazi  Party  organization  called  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Department  for  Policies  and  Economics.  It's  not  formally  a  part  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">government  but  has,  of  course,  immense  power  .  .  .  because  it  instructs  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">the government on what the Nazi party decides shall be economic policy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  present  when  Mr.  Heidinger  received  a  request  or  summons  to  visit </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Keppler and the morning afterwards when I saw Dr. Albert, he told me he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had not slept all night.... Until this time, Dr. Albert had been ardendy fighting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Heidinger  with  respect  to  any  reorganization  of  Dehomag.  .  .  .  The  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">question  of  competition  was  whether  or  not  the  managers  were  strong  enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">to fight, and whether our machines and prices could meet the competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Albert  did  not  tell  me  what  the  conversation  was  between  Mr.  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger,  Dr.  Keppler  and  himself,  but  did  tell  me  of  the  conversation  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Veesenmayer  which  conversation  was  after  the  talk  with  Dr.  Keppler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Albert  informed  me  that  Dr.  Veesenmayer  had  said  that  under  no  circum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stances  would  any  coercion  be  used  to  force  the  IBM  to  give  up  the  majority </p>
<p class="calibre1">but that it appeared advisable that the IBM should do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Veesenmayer  had  asked  that  Dr.  Albert  and  Mr.  Heidinger  agree  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">plan  to  effect  the  reorganization  and  that  I  should  agree  in  writing  to  such  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">plan  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  IBM.  Dr.  Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted  to  get  me  to  agree,  which  I  refused  on  the  ground  that  any  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">tentative  agreement  would  lead  to  the  belief  officially  that  it  would  be  car- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ried out.... If the IBM did not desire to approve it. .. [then] IBM's position </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  [only]  be  more  difficult  w i t h   the  officials.  I  told  Dr.  Albert  that  all  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  authorize  him  to  say  to  Dr.  Veesenmayer  was  that  there  had  been  sev- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eral plans submitted to me and these I would in turn submit to the IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Albert  told  me  that  Dr.  Veesenmayer  had  [then]  expressed  a  desire  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">see  me  but  not  in  his  office,  as  he  would  like  the  conversation  to  be  unoffi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial.  Tentative  arrangements  were  made  for  me  to  meet  him  at  lunch.  How- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever,  Dr.  Albert  called  me  one  day  and informed  me  that  he  was  going  to  see </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Veesenmayer  on  the  next  day....  Dr.  Albert  called  me  later  and  said  that  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">should go with him to Dr. Veesenmayer's office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Veesenmayer  stated  [to  me]  that  there  were  advantages  to  be  gained </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  friendly  agreements  between  industries  in  America  and  Germany  and  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was  not  unusual  to  find  a  desire  to  have  industries  owned  by  the  nationals </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  a  country.  I  told  him  that  I  appreciated  the  advantages  of  a  nationally- </p>
<p class="calibre1">owned  company  whether  in  Germany  or  elsewhere.  I  pointed  out  to  him  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  could  be  used  [just  as  easily]  against  Dehomag  [if  it  were] </p>
<p class="calibre1">partly-owned  by  the  IBM  as  it  could  be  used  when  IBM  practically  owned </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  entire  company  ...  I  asked  him  what  guarantees  IBM  could  have  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  of  its  minority,  assuming  that  it  gave  up  its  majority.  He  [Veesen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mayer]  suggested  that  no  guarantees  could  be  made  in  writing  but  that  if  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Government  approved  of  the  act  of  increasing  the  capital  and  the  disposition </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  it  to  Germans,  that  should  be  all  the  security  we  need  ask  for.  Dr.  Veesen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mayer  did  not  speak  English  very  well  but  I  understood  him  to  say  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  instrumental  in  assisting  in  the  re-organization  of  the  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telephone  Company  in  Spain.  Subsequendy  I  attempted,  through  Dr.  Albert, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to have Dr. Veesenmayer give me the names of American companies which he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  also  assisted  in  re-organizing.  The  reply  was  that  he  could  not  give  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  names  but  that  he  could  tell  me  that  he  had  just  about  closed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements  with  two  other  American  companies.  In  this  connection  I  saw </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  a  moment  the  names  of  three  German  companies  which  have  been  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">organized.  I  did  not  have  the  opportunity  to  get  down  these  names,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">were in German, nor could I identify them with any American company. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.  Kiep  seemed  to  be  of  the  opinion  that  Dr.  Keppler's  introduction  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  matter  was  occasioned  by  Mr.  Heidinger.  This  may  be  so  but  I  do  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">believe  that  Mr.  Heidinger  himself  got  in  touch  with  Dr.  Keppler  or  Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  because  he  appeared  to  be  as  much  concerned  about  the  call  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Keppler's office as was Dr. Albert. It is possible, however, that through his </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  friends  he  [Heidinger]  may  have  brought  Dr.  Keppler  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">subject.117 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon after Chauncey met with Veesenmayer Albert delivered to Chaun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cey  a  short  unsigned,  unaddresscd  note,  typed  on  plain  paper.  Chauncey  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">warded that to New York as well through diplomatic pouch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  party  with  whom  you  have  discussed  the  matter  of  IBM  is  Mr.  Veesen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mayer.  He  is  the right  hand  of  Dr.  Keppler,  Secretary  of  State  in  the Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Foreign  Affairs,  but  at  the  same  time  being  entrusted,  as  an  important </p>
<p class="calibre1">member  of  the  party  with  certain  special  duties  and  responsibilities,  F.I.  [for </p>
<p class="calibre1">instance]  concerning  questions  of  political  economic  organizations.  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  confirmed  the  official  attitude  that  no  pressure  should  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought  on  IBM  to  transfer  its  majority  into  German  hands,  but  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  it  advisable  to  do  so.  His  recommendation  to  you  was  to  lose  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  in  reporting  to  IBM  and  then  to  return  as  soon  as  possible  to  Berlin  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">order to carry the plan through.118 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things  began  happening  rapid-fire.  On  December  5,  Heidinger  sud- </p>
<p class="calibre1">denly  agreed  to  accept  a  vastly  lower  purchase  price  for  his  shares,  just  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.9  million.  What's  more,  he  would  accept  payment  in  IBM's  blocked  marks </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  no  longer insist  upon dollars.  A contract  with  IBM  was  quickly  drawn  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">and signed on December 13, 1940.119 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  felt  Heidinger's  war  was  on  hold,  at  least  for  the  moment.  But  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">continuing  pressure  for  IBM  to  relinquish  its  majority  remained  intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally  manifest  was  the  air  of  tight-lipped  mystery  surrounding  what  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  had  in  mind  for  the  machines.  Chauncey  studiously  avoided  ever  ask- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  what  additional  tasks  the  machines  were  intended  for.  He  nonetheless </p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed  ahead,  demonstrating  IBM  NY's  intention  to  remain  a  reliable  ven- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dor  to  the  Reich.  He  began  organizing  new  support  for  Germany's  needs  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied  France,  and  declared  his  readiness  to  integrate  IBM's  Polish  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary  into  Dehomag  proper.  He  even  offered  to  extend  Dehomag's  territory </p>
<p class="calibre1">into Russia, which many believed Germany was preparing to invade.120 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  still,  a  new  plan  was  emerging.  The  Third  Reich  was  now  hoping </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  expand  Dehomag  and  all  its  dominated  European  IBM  subsidiaries  into  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">huge all-inclusive Nazi cartel governed by the Maschinelles Berichtwesen, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  agency  for  punch  card  technology.  This  cartel  would  be  strengthened </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  inclusion  of  the  marginal  European  branches  of  Powers,  as  well  as  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">local  companies  in  invaded  lands,  such  as  Bull  in  France  and  Kamatec  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland.  Machines  would  be  transported  from  country  to  country,  like  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  mortars,  across  war-ravaged  Europe  to  the  precise  locales  needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once their mission was accomplished, the devices would be shifted to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  hot  spot.  The  pillars  of  the  cartel  would  be  the  well  developed  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries  in  Italy,  France,  and  Holland.  In  fact,  a  special  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">employee  named  Heinz  Westerholt,  the  Nazi  Party's  direct  agent  within  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary,  had  already  traveled  to  France  to  initiate  the  arrangements  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  Vichy  and  occupied  territory.  The  Germans  working  through  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  had  already  demanded  a  test  integration  of  Bull  systems  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith tabulators and sorters.121 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  planned  punch  card  cartel  would  then  be  able  to  accomplish  all  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  most  important  objectives  without  channeling  requests  through  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  corporate  bureaucracy  or  submitting  to  Watson  micro-management. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  IBM-based  cartel  could  function  as  a  binary  with  Watson's  non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">European operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  the  attempted  cartel  would  be  bitterly  fought  by  Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">deploying  every  technologic,  legal,  financial,  and  political  argument  at  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">disposal.  Eventually,  by  mid-1941,  the  Nazis  concluded  that  connecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holleriths  to  other  systems  was  mechanically  impossible,  and  operationally </p>
<p class="calibre1">naive.  Unlikable  as  it  was,  Germany  needed  an  agreement  with  Watson  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  he  agreed  to  supply  all  the  Reich's  needs,  receive  proper  payment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  remain  detached  from  the  local  details  his  managers  and  engineers </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  necessarily  possess.  Ironically,  such  a  modus  vivendi  appealed  gready </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  as  a  company  would  know  the  innermost  details  of  Hitler's  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  operations,  designing  the  programs,  printing  the  cards,  and  servicing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines. But Watson and his New York directors could erect a wall of credi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ble  deniability  at  the  doors  of  the  executive  suite.  In  theory,  only  those  down </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  hall  in  the  New  York  headquarters  who  communicated  direcdy  with  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva,  such  as  IBM  European  General  Manager  Schotte,  could  provide  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">link  to  the  reality  in  Europe.  But  in  fact,  any  such  wall  contained  so  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">cracks,  gaps,  and  hatches  as  to  render it  imaginary.  The free  flow  of informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion,  instructions,  requests,  and  approvals  by  Watson  remained  detailed  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">continuous for years to come—until well into 1944. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Subsidiary  managers  were  authorized  by  New  York  to  negotiate  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment  rental  and  service  agreements  from  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  Reich  officials.  Projects  in  Europe  were  approved  and  customers </p>
<p class="calibre1">prioritized  with  New  York's  permission.  Machines  were  moved  from  place  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">place  to  meet  the  demand.  IBM  Europe's  managers  received  special  permis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion  from  the  Nazi  authorities  to  travel  back  and  forth  between  neutral </p>
<p class="calibre1">nations,  Nazi-held  territory,  and  Germany  itself.  They  regularly  sent  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">letters and reports. Some were simply handwritten notes. Others were dense </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales and machine status reports, or meticulous monthly summaries, all sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">from Axis-contr olled subsidiaries to New York through neutral cities.122 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Geneva  executives  were  pressed  for  time,  they  telephoned  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York.  Using  codes  and  oblique  references,  they  nonetheless  all  spoke  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">same  language,  even  when  the  language  was  vague.  As  one  previous  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean  General  Manager,  John  Holt,  urged  an  IBM  NY  colleague  early  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war:  "wire  Schotte  for  the  information  which  you  need,  care  being  taken  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">your  request  is  so  worded  that  it  can  pass  the  censor.  It  goes  without  saying </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  any  information  covering  military  activity  is  apt  to  get  the  recipient,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well as the sender, into considerable 'hot water.'"123 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together  the  continuous  reports,  summaries,  cables,  and  telephone  calls </p>
<p class="calibre1">offered  minute-to-minute  operational  details  of  IBM's  activities  in  France, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Italy,  and  Sweden;  the  serial  number  and  location  of  equipment;  and  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cisely  which  machines  were  destined  to  be  shipped  to  Dehomag  or  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  army.  Devices  and  spare  parts  going  into  the  Reich  or  elsewhere  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-conquered  Europe  were  tracked  by  New  York—from  the  most  complex </p>
<p class="calibre1">collator  to  the  simplest  sorting  brush.  Despite  the  turmoil  of  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">revolt,  throughout  1940  and  1941  the  fluid  decision  to  build  new  factories </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  supply  Nazi  Germany,  the  stocking  of  those  factories,  and  the  year-to-year </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordering  of  expensive  machine  tools,  these  decisions  were  made  by  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">based  on  the  most  current  market  information.  Paper  factory  output  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipated  shortages  throughout  Europe  were  monitored  to  anticipate  prob- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lems before they occurred.124 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millions  of  punch  cards  were  routinely  shipped  from  IBM  in  America </p>
<p class="calibre1">directly  to  Nazi-controlled  sources  in  Poland,  France,  Bulgaria,  and  Belgium, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  routed  circuitously  through  Sweden  or  colonies  in  Africa.  When  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  presses  did  not  fill  orders,  subsidiaries  themselves  would  ship </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards across frontiers from one IBM location to another.125 </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  money  was  accounted  for  and  audited  down  to  the  franc  and  lira. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  expenses  were  deferentially  proposed  to  New  York  and  carefully  ap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">proved  or  rejected.  Watson  was  even  told  that  the  French  subsidiary  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">charged an extra 1.5 francs for wine with lunch in the company canteen.126 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  in  December  1940,  things  were  different.  The  plan  for  an  MB  cartel </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  still  very  much  alive  in  the  Nazi  game  plan.  Moreover,  the  constantly </p>
<p class="calibre1">evolving  special  plans  for  Hitler's  Holleriths  were  beginning  to  take  shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Periodically,  when  Chauncey  inadvertently  raised  an  issue  that  came  close  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cartel  question,  the  managers  at  Dehomag  would  mysteriously  comment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"there  were  concentration  camps,"  and  then  become  completely  silent.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">December 13, 1940, Chauncey wrote to Watson, "I mentioned to Hummel </p>
<p class="calibre1">that now might be a good opportunity to acquire our rights from Bull, he </p>
<p class="calibre1">vaguely  hinted  that  perhaps  the  Bull  Company  in  France  has  already  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">acquired  by  others.  When  I  pressed  him  for  an  explanation,  he  would  say </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  more.  When  I  reach  a  point  with  these  fellows,  they  begin  to  talk  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration camps, etc."127 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  days  later,  on  December  17,  Chauncey  was  discussing  the  issue  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  defecting  to  a  competitive  company  and  destroying  the  subsidiary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel  first  swore  Chauncey  to  secrecy  and  then  revealed,  "Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  never  fight  Dehomag."  Chauncey  then  reported  to  IBM  NY  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">"went  along  with  him  [Hummel]  in  the  hopes  that  he  would  not  retire  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  shell,  or  completely  shut  up  with  the  explanation  that  'there  were  concen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration camps'!"128 </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  that  time,  Otto  Kiep  surprised  Chauncey  by  mysteriously  stating </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was  better  for  directors  to  decline  any  stock  in  Dehomag—even  token </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rock.  On  December  13,  Chauncey  wrote  to  Watson  without  elaborating,  "it </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  Mr.  Kiep's  opinion  that  no  shares  should  be  issued  to  the  directors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  something  he  has  learned."  Like  the  other  messages,  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">channeled the message through the Embassy.129 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  made  clear  to  Watson  in  his  various  writings  that  Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">use  of  machines  throughout  conquered  Europe  would  be  profoundly  lucra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive,  and  IBM  could  not  give  up  the  profits.  Albert  described  an  enticing </p>
<p class="calibre1">Axis-wide  punch  card  monopoly  that  would  rule  in  "Germany's  possible </p>
<p class="calibre1">future  economic  space  comprising  not  only  the  increased  [Reich]  territory </p>
<p class="calibre1">[itself],  but  the  sphere  of...  Central  Europe  to  the  Balkans,  the  African  pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sessions, and the Near East."130 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  to  remain  a  viable  member  of  the  Nazi  juggernaut,  Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">explained,  Watson  would  have  to  adopt  a  decision  not  to  just  do  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  and  extract  profit  from  Nazi  Germany,  but  to  ensure  that  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  an  organic  facet  of  the  Third  Reich  itself.  In  a  twenty-one-page  rec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ommendation  to  Watson,  Albert  circumlocutiously  described  the  cooperation </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  expected.  "The  structure  of  the  German  economic  system," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert  wrote,  "requires  that  every  German  undertaking  is  completely,  loyally </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  without  any  reservation  a  member  of  that  system,  as  formed  by  National </p>
<p class="calibre1">Socialist  leadership.  What  matters  is  .  .  .  the  spirit  of  German  economic  lead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ership—and  not  who  is  the  owner  of  the  shares....  the  business  policy  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  company  .  .  .  [must  be]  in  complete  harmony  with  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  interests,  and  it  is  the  business  of  the  men  at  the  head  of  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  undertaking  to  see  to  that.  Of  course,  if  the  company's  interests  are  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">so defended, either because the parties concerned grow weary under the </p>
<p class="calibre1">weight  of  those  difficulties...  [or]  perhaps  became  at  heart  they  themselves </p>
<p class="calibre1">share the adversarial point of view... the company will suffer."131 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  willing  to  cooperate—as  he  had  done  since  the  first  days  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich.  But  why  was  it  necessary  to  give  up  majority  ownership? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Majority  ownership  was  something  a  man  like  Watson  could  not  bear  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">relinquish.  But  everything  seemed  to  rest  on  that  very  fulcrum:  IBM  becom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing a minority owner of its own enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  if  IBM  reduced  its  ownership  to  less  than  50  percent  would  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">contemplated  competition  be  suppressed  and  Watson's  profits  be  protected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  the  guarantees,  all  oral,  seemed  too  vague  for  IBM  to  trust.  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  Watson,  "Dr.  Veesenmayer  .  .  .  stated  that  he  was  not  in  a  position  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">give  me  any  written  statement,"  and  added  that  "the  transaction  must  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">approved  by  the  [German]  government  and  that  would  be  all  the  guarantee </p>
<p class="calibre1">we  needed."  Chauncey  also  reported  his  conversation  with  a  director  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deutsche  Bank,  Dr.  Kimlich,  who  concurred  with  Veesenmayer.  "Dr.  Kimlich </p>
<p class="calibre1">stated  that  his  organization  [Deutsche  Bank]  would  take  care  of  any  competi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion, ... [a] statement he would not amplify, but only repeated."132 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reducing  ownership  to  a  minority  bothered  Chauncey's  sense  of  profit </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well.  "IBM  will  have  reduced  its  interest  in  the  German  company  to  less </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  50  percent,"  he  complained  to  New  York,  "and  its  share  of  the  future </p>
<p class="calibre1">profits  proportionately."133  IBM  wanted  both—to  remain  a  commercial  part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Nazi domination in Europe and keep all the profits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  Watson  could  decide.  Chauncey  confirmed  to  Watson  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  senior  executives  in  New  York  that  he  had  promised  Veesenmayer  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  would  fly  back  to  America  and  brief  company  officials.  Then  he  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  fly  back  to  Berlin  and  personally  deliver  to  Veesenmayer  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">answer.134 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  would  now  play  a  special  role  both  with  IBM  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third  Reich's  war  against  the  Jews.  As  statistics  and  human  sorting  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinued  in  the  drama  of  Jewish  destruction,  the  two  would  intertwine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey's  chaotic  consultations  with  Veesenmayer  and  others  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">future  of  IBM  in  Europe  would  keep  the  young  attorney  in  Berlin  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva until late March 1941.135 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  days  after  Chauncey  finally  departed  for  New  York,  Veesenmayer </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  travel to  Yugoslavia  to  oversee  the  Reich's  affairs  with  the  Ustashi.  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">early  April,  Veesenmayer  was  arranging  with  Croat  leaders  and  the  Ustashi </p>
<p class="calibre1">"an exact plan for the assumption of power."136 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Veesenmayer ultimately emerged as much more than just Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">envoy  to  communal  destruction.  He  would  soon  become  a  technical  sched- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uler of actual genocide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  earliest  episodes  occurred  in  fall  1941.  Germany's  Minister </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Yugoslavia,  Fritz  Benzler,  asked  for  an  expert  to  handle  difficulties  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jewish  situation.  The  Foreign  Office  sent  Veesenmayer.  On  September  8, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  and  Benzler  proposed  that  8,000  Jews  in  Serbia  be  deported </p>
<p class="calibre1">down  the  Danube  on  barges  into  Romania  for  further  action.  Berlin  did  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">answer  quickly  enough,  so  forty-eight  hours  later  Veesenmayer  and  his  col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">league  sent  a  follow-up  dispatch:  "Quick  and  draconian  settlement  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Serbian  Jewish  question  is  most  urgent.  .  .  .  Request  authorization  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foreign  Minister  to  place  maximum  pressure  on  the  Serbian  military  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mander . No opposition is to be expected from the Serb government."137 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,  the  question  was  routed  to  Adolf  Eichmann,  the  Reich's  expert </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Jewish  affairs.  The  reply:  "Eichmann  proposes  shooting."  By  September </p>
<p class="calibre1">28,  the  German  general  commander  in  the  area  wanted  all  8,000  rounded  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  "immediate  elimination."  In  early  October  1941,  German  army  comman- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ders  in  conjunction  with  Serb  mayors  and  police  began  picking  up  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  cities  and  towns  in  a  lightning  Aktion,  or  Action.  Victims  were  driven </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  then  marched  to  an  open  pit  in  a  remote  location,  and  there  ordered  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">kneel  over  the  trench.  German  soldiers  at  ten  paces  would  fire  rifles  at  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">head  and  chest.  Line  by  line,  thousands  of  murdered  Jews  slumped  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">earth.138 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Days  later,  the  Foreign  Office  rebuked  Benzler  and  Veesenmayer  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming  too  involved  in  the  technical  and  military  aspects.  They  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded  to  confine  themselves  to  such  matters  as  simply  arranging  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portation.139 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  in  July  1943,  Foreign  Minister  von  Ribbentrop  wanted  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiso  of  Slovakia  to  accelerate  the  "cleanup"  of the Jewish  question  there.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slovakians  were  reluctant  because  the  war  was  not  going  well  for  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Slovakian  leaders  could  no  longer  plead  ignorance  of  the  genocide.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1943,  Veesenmayer  was  again  sent  to  Bratislava.  In  one  meeting </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Eichmann's  expert  Dieter  Wisliceny,  Veesenmayer  angrily  reviewed </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann's  detailed  statistical  reports  of  Slovakian  Jews  both  by  ancestry </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  religious  belief.  Veesenmayer  was  impatient  for  action.  He  vowed  to  talk </p>
<p class="calibre1">"blundy"  with  President  Tiso.  After  their  talks,  Tiso  agreed  to  transport  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining  16,000  to  18,000  unconverted  Jews  to  concentration  camps—no </p>
<p class="calibre1">exceptions  permitted.  Shortly  thereafter,  10,000  baptized  Jews  were  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the rolls.140 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  spring  1944,  after  a  stint  at  der  Fuhrer's  headquarters,  Veesenmayer </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  sent  East  again,  this  ti me   as  Minister  to  Hungary.  His  instructions </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  to  form  a  new  puppet  government  in  Budapest  and  organize  the  Hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">garian railroads.141 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  was  for  the  first  time  completely  in  charge  of  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations  in  a  puppet  nation.  In  Budapest,  he  formed  a  close  alliance  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann  and  together  they  orchestrated  the  systematic  destruction  of  Hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">garian  Jewry.  According  to  Veesenmayer's  1941  census  statistics,  724,307 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  lived  in  Hungary.  Another  62,000  were  considered  Jewish  by  blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Hungarian  leaders,  although  rabidly  anti-Semitic,  were  reluctant  to  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinue  their  on-again  off-again  persecution  of  the  Jews.  The  Allies  had  already </p>
<p class="calibre1">announced  that  there  would  be  war  crime  tribunals  for  genocide.  Warnings </p>
<p class="calibre1">conveyed  by  neutral  leaders  and  the  Vatican  were  coming  in  continuously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian  troops  were  steadily  advancing  from  the  East.  The  Hungarians  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">openly worried.142 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Veesenmayer,  with  Eichmann  at  his  side,  hammered  out  a  domestic </p>
<p class="calibre1">power-sharing  agreement  with  those  Hungarian  leaders  that  would  ignore </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Allies  and  cooperate  with  Hitler's  mandate.  To  ensure  close  supervision, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he installed his own expert in the Hungarian Office of Jewish Affairs to mon- </p>
<p class="calibre1">itor  a  torrent  of  anti-Semitic  decrees.  Veesenmayer  described  the  progress  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">one of "unusual rapidity under local conditions."143 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  few  weeks  later,  with  confiscation  and  ghettoization  nearly  complete, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  deportations  began.  Veesenmayer  divided  Hungary  into  five  zones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">plus  Budapest.  But  Zone  1,  the  Carpathians,  required  a  full  seven  weeks  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">empty  because  not  enough  trains  were  available.  On  April  20,  1944,  Veesen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mayer  complained  to  the  Foreign  Office  that  he  was  unable  to  locate  enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  cars  for  his  task.  But  by  the  end  of  April,  two  trains  were  arranged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each  carried  4,000  Jews  from  the  Kistarcsa  internment  camp.  Destination: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auschwitz.144 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  would  learn  to  locate  freight  cars  and  schedule  them  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  out  of  Hungary  like  clockwork.  As  efficiency  increased,  only  ten  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  needed  per  zone.  After  the  zones  were  emptied  in  late  June, </p>
<p class="calibre1">437,402  Jews  were  gone.  But  then  a  struggle  ensued  as  to  whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">Budapest's  Jews  would  be  deported  to  their  death  as  well.  Hungarian  leaders </p>
<p class="calibre1">hated  Jews  but  feared  war  crimes  trials  more.  Veesenmayer  did  not  care  how </p>
<p class="calibre1">close  the  Russians  were.  A  stalemate  developed  with  Hungarian  Chief  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Admiral  Miklos  Horthy.  Eichmann  sent  one  train  filled  with  Budapest </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  to  a  death  camp  only  to  have  Horthy  order  it  stopped  at  the  border  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent back.145 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horthy  eventually  dismissed  the  puppet  leaders  Veesenmayer  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">installed  and  ordered  their  arrest.  Veesenmayer  protested  bitterly  and  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plained  to  Berlin.  Von  Ribbentrop  telegraphed  a  warning:  "The  Fuhrer  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pects  that  the  measures  against  the  Budapest  Jews  will  now  be  taken  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">any further delay by the Hungarian government ... no delay of any kind in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the execution of the general measures against Jews [will be permitted]."146 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veesenmayer  then  warned  Horthy  that  two  additional  Wehrmacht </p>
<p class="calibre1">armored  units  would  soon  be  sent  to  Hungary.  Horthy  still  refused  to  coop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erate.  Eventually,  Veesenmayer  ordered  Horthy's  son  kidnapped.  Bundled </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  a  blanket,  the  son  was  driven  to  an  airfield  and  flown  to  Mauthausen </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration  camp  in  Austria.  Veesenmayer  threatened  to  have  the  younger </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horthy shot if Hungary did not comply.147 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compromises,  broken  and  amended,  were  made  with  Hungarian  lead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers.  Eventually,  Hungary  agreed  to  deport  50,000  Jews  to  Austria  and,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">remainder  of  Budapest  Jewry  were  sent  to  concentration  camps.  Beginning </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  October  20,  1944,  thousands  of  terrified,  weeping  Jews  were  pulled  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">t h e i r   apartments  and  homes  in  all-day  operations.  There  weren't  enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  cars.  So  within  days,  the  27,000  assembled  Jews  were  sent  on  a  death </p>
<p class="calibre1">march  to  the  Austrian  border.  Lines  of  marching  Jews  stretched  out  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Budapest,  miles  and  miles  long,  girded  by  a  parallel  of  corpses  heaped  along </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  road.  Veesenmayer  reported  that  2,000  to  4,000  were  being  added  daily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  thousands  died  en  route  from  the  exhaustion,  exposure,  and  starva- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. They were in fact marched to death.148 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  war  years,  IBM  supplied  elaborate  Hollerith  systems  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly  all  the  railways  of  Nazi-dominated  Europe.149  Knowing  how  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  cars  and  locomotives  to  schedule  on  any  given  day  in  any  given  loca- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion,  anywhere  across  the  map  of  Europe,  required  the  computational  capa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bilities  of  Hollerith.150  Punch  card  systems  identified  the  exact  location  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">each  freight  car,  how  much  cargo  it  could  accept,  and  what  schedule  it  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">adhere  to  for  maximum  efficiency.151  In  fact,  the  main  method  of  tracking </p>
<p class="calibre1">freight  cars  was  a  network  of  Hollerith  systems  installed  at  railroad  junctions </p>
<p class="calibre1">across  Europe.152  Using  IBM  equipment,  freight  car  locations  were  updated </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  forty-eight  hours.  Without  it,  the  location  of  rolling  stock  would  gener- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  be  more  than  two  weeks  out  of  date  and  useless  in  a  wartime  setting.153 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1938  alone,  more  than  200  million  punch  cards  were  printed  for  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean  railroads.154  In  Nazi  Poland,  the  railroads,  which  constituted  some  95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent  of  the  IBM  subsidiary's  business,  were  accustomed  to  using  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  21  million  cards  annually.155  In  Nazi-allied  Romania,  the  railroads  used </p>
<p class="calibre1">a large installation of machines in the Ministry of Communications.156 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Yugoslavia,  where  Veesenmayer  worked  with  the  Ustashi,  the  rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roads  used  Ministry  of  Commerce  machines  in  Belgrade.157  In  Hungary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  Veesenmayer  and  Eichmann  coordinated  continuously  with  the  rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roads,  the  machines  were  Holleriths.158  Standardized  forms  on  daily  reports </p>
<p class="calibre1">registered  every  detail  of  train  operation  from  passenger  load  per  car  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">fuel  consumed  per  train,  to  locomotive  efficiency  and  which  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">department  would  be  billed  for  the  freight.159  Hollerith  made  the  trains  run </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  time  in  Nazi  Europe.  These  were  the  trains  Veesenmayer  and  his  cohorts </p>
<p class="calibre1">relied upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  all  the  genocide  years,  1942-1945,  the  Dehomag  that  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">fought  to  protect  did  remain  intact.  Ultimately,  it  was  governed  by  a  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  advisory  committee  representing  the  highest  echelons  of  the  Nazi  hier- </p>
<p class="calibre1">archy.  The  Dehomag  advisory  committee  replaced  the  traditional  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">board  of  directors.  As  with  any  board,  the  committee's  duty  was  to  advise </p>
<p class="calibre1">senior  management,  approve  and  veto  special  projects,  and  mandate  priori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties.  The  day-to-day  decisions  were  left  to  managers  to  execute.  When </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed,  it  coordinated  with  IBM  Geneva  or  its  representatives  in  other  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries.  Four  men  sat  on  the  advisory  board.  One  was  a  trustee.  Second  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passow,  chief  of  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen.  Third  was  Heidinger.  Fourth </p>
<p class="calibre1">was Adolf Hitler's personal representative.160 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  representative  on  Dehomag's  advisory  committee  was  Dr.  Ed- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mund Veesenmayer.161 </p>
