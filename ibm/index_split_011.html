<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Haug  moved  the  service  bureau  here  because  it  appeared  safer </p>
<p class="calibre1">from bombing attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time  and  duty  did  not  permit  me  to  investigate  further  but  the  fol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lowing  items  Mr.  Haug  gave  me:  all  spare  parts  and  replacement  parts </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  moved  from  Stuttgart  to  Kuchen.  Here  also  you  shall  find  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">wiring  department,  plugboard  and  small  assembly  plants.  Hechingen  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  gathering  point  for  all  sub-assemblies.  Here  everything  was  assem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bled  and  Mr.  Haug  believes  the  plant  is  not  bombed  but  in  good  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dition.  At  Berlin,  there  is  still  a  sub-unit  assembly  plant.  Mr.  Rottke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Hummel  and  Mr.  Haug  sometime  in  last  autumn  made  all  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">above  changes  ...  as  a  safety  measure.  At  Sindelfingen,  Mr.  Haug  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Wiesinger  have  done  a  wonderful  job  in  spite  of  very  trying  diffi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">culties  and  the  plant  being  100%  intact  could  be  very  beneficial  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Allied Armies for spare parts, paper stock and such. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  you  so  well  know  Mr.  Watson,  fraternization  is  forbidden,  but  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  instance  I  was  working  under  orders  handed  down  in  a  directive </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  all  MRUs  from  the  Supreme  Headquarters.  All  my  dealings  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Haug  and  Mr.  Wiesinger  were  only  of  this  nature  but  I  know  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">would like to be remembered to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">James T. Senn </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth MRU28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Senn's  letter  was  typical.  Watson  received  reports  from  any  number  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">sources,  whether  IBM  Soldiers  or  Dehomag  employees.  Dehomag  staffers </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  able  to  direct  their  messages  through  IBM  Soldiers,  who  would  pass </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  on  through  the  ordinary  mail.  Whether  an  IBM  Soldier  or  a  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">employee,  most  asked  for  instructions  guiding  their  next  effort  on  behalf  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  on  May  10,  just  two  days  after  Berlin  fell,  Dehomag  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gineer  Alfred  Dicke,  dutifully  dispatched  an  emergency  message  to  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">in New York: "Hereby I wish to inform you," reported Dicke, "of the transfer </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Patent  Department...  from  the  plant  in  Berlin  to  Hechingen/Hohen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">zollern,  a  town...  which  you  know  from  your  visit  in  former  days.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">account  of  the  frequent  air  attacks  on  Berlin  and  the  approach  of  the  Allied </p>
<p class="calibre1">Armies  it  became  impossible  to  remain  in  Berlin  any  longer,  and  it  was  nec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">essary  to  bring  the  valuable  patent  files,  of  which  many  documents  cannot  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">reproduced, to safer places.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  plant  in  Berlin,"  Dicke  continued,  "has  been  gradually  destroyed </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  incendiary  bombs  since  1943.  Most  of  the  departments  have  been  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred  to  different  places  in  southern  Germany,  so  that  one  cannot  speak  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  of  a  main  office  in Berlin.  . .  . Would  you  find  it  advisable  to  move  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">complete  files  to  the  'Compagnie  Electro-Comptable'  .  .  .  [in]  Paris  or  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'International Business Machines Corporation' in Geneva?"30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  August  22,  1945,  Capt.  Leonard  V.  Salisbury,  A  Company,  750  Tank </p>
<p class="calibre1">Battalion,  sent  a  short  note  to  IBM  advising  that  a  letter  from  IBM's  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  attorney  had  been  sent  via  the  Rochester,  New  York,  factory.  Salisbury </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  dispatched  a  report  of  his  own  personal  inspection  of  the  Lichterfelde </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  and  office.  "The  outstanding  observation  I  noticed,"  reported  Salis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bury,  "was  the  optimism  of  [Dehomag  managers]  Mr.  Cimbal,  Mr.  Kolm  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Brockman  for  the  future  business  of  IBM  in  this,  a  shattered  city.  With </p>
<p class="calibre1">such a spirit, the future is very bright.  If  I can be of any aid as liaison or oth- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erwise  will  be  only  be  too  glad  to  do  so  . . .   I  hope  to  see  all  my  IBM  friends </p>
<p class="calibre1">by Christmas."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  same  steady  flow  of  information  reached  IBM  NY  from  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">forces  elsewhere  in  liberated  Europe.  In  one  instance,  IBM  became  impatient </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  reports  on  the  Dehomag  facility  in  Austria  when  it  had  heard  no  news  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">three weeks. William W Bass of IBM NY's Foreign Trade Department commu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nicated  with  his  son,  an  army  lieutenant  stationed  in  Vienna.  Lieutenant  Bass </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  turn  provided  a  report  which  was  passed  from  the  military  headquarters  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vienna to the State Department in Washington, and from there to IBM NY.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  chaotic  first  months  of  the  Allied  occupation  of  Germany,  a  faith- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ful, if officious, network of IBM Soldiers tried to outdo each other in advanc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  cause  of  Dehomag.  Perhaps  none  caused  the  waves  that  Lt.  Col. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lawrence  G.  Flick  did.  The  Russians  arrested  Rottke  on  May  11  for  his  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">connections.  Allied  forces  arrested  Hummel  shortly  thereafter.  Lieutenant </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel  Flick,  an  MRU  officer, tried  his  best to  help  IBM  by  restoring  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag's prior management.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  2,  1945,  Flick  wrote  a  long  letter  to  Watson.  "I  am  leav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  Berlin  tomorrow  for  Frankfurt,"  he  advised.  'There  I  shall  endeavor  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">locate Karl Hummel and do what I can to expedite his return to Berlin. As </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  will  see  later  there  is  a  considerable  difference  of  opinion  amongst  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">involved  in  handling  the  affairs  of  Dehomag.  But  on  two  things  all  seem  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  agreed.  One  is  the  return  of  Dr.  Rottke.  This  I  am  afraid  is  highly  prob- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lematical.  Although  some  have  returned  after  arrest  by  the  Russians,  they  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">few  and  usually  not  in  the  best  physical  condition.  Second  is  the  return  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel.  This  can  be  accomplished  if  his  health  permits  his  travelling  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">the existing very trying conditions.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Last  evening,"  continued  Flick,  "I  spent  with  Captain  Arthur  D.  Reed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Property  Control  Officer  of  the  Military  Government.  He  is  the  custodian  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  businesses,  a  highly  intelligent  and  earnest  man  of  about  forty....  Captain </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reed  is  in  accord  with  any  personal  efforts  I  have  and  can  make  on  behalf  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">my company. He is sold on ... Fellinger, and has given him a position of trust </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  his  section,  that  of  trustee  of  former  Nazi  businesses.  He  also  uses </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger as counsillor on IBM policy.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After  my  conversation  with  Captain  Reed,"  Flick  went  on,  "it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreed  that  I  might  communicate  with  Fellinger  through  him,  and,  if  you  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">desire,  I  will  forward  any  directions  in  this  manner  until  more  normal  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">munications  are  restored.  Also  through  Reed,  I  was  able  to  locate  Major  An- </p>
<p class="calibre1">drew  Haensel  from  whom  you  may  have  heard  through  [Watson  aide]  Jack </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenney.  I  spent  the  morning  with  Haensel  and  am  forwarding  some  reports </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  this  meeting  as  enclosures  hereto.  .  .  .  Haensel  has  done  an  outstanding </p>
<p class="calibre1">job  of  cooperation  insofar  as  he  can  do  so  within  existing  regulations.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">same  is  true  of  Captain  Reed.  I  made  arrangements  with  Haensel,  to  forward </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  communications  to  the  present  executives  of  the  company  here  in  Berlin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  copy  to  Reed  and  vice  versa.  Thus,  any  correspondence  will  be  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tirely  on  the  up  and  up,  and  will  by  the  same  token  be  subject  to  military </p>
<p class="calibre1">screening. The three of us will keep in touch with one another as stated."36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flick  also  addressed  the  difficulty  of  significant  cash  accounts  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  that  were  blocked  and  therefore  unavailable  to  defray  the  day-to-day </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs of Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  company  [Dehomag]  needs  cash,"  wrote  Flick.  "Reed,  Haensel,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger  have  all  indicated  that  a  matter  of  one  hundred  fifty  thousand  marks </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  keep  the  breath  of  life  in  the  organization  for  a  period  of  three  months </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  it  might  be  possible  to  operate  more  normally  once  again.  If  I  get  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hamburg  I  will  endeavor  to  do  something  about  this  if  it  can  be  done  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">existing  regulations.  Haensel,  who  is  quite  thoroughly  informed,  holds  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">little hope that any capital in Berlin will be available for a long time."37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flick  concluded  his  long  report  to  Watson,  "In  the  meanwhile  I  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciate hearing from you on the matter of how much interest any of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBMers should continue to take in European business, etc. Until I hear fur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther,  I  shall  endeavor  to  pick  up  any  and  a l l   data  that  may  be  of  interest  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">you.  It is of course obvious that much of the data may already be available to </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  or  may  duplicate  information,  which  you  have  had  for  some  time.  There </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  no  way  of  avoiding  this,  and  it  is  only  with  the  hope  that  what  is  gathered </p>
<p class="calibre1">may  be  of  help  to  the  home  office,  that  we  in  the  field,  are  gathering  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">considerable difficulty, the material which is being sent in."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  did  not  appreciate  the  help.  In  IBM's  view,  the  IBM  Soldiers </p>
<p class="calibre1">rendered  invaluable  service  to  the  company.  But  he  saw  Flick's  helpfulness </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying  to  restore  Hummel  as  unwanted  interference.  Watson  had  no  intention </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  re-empowering  the  leaders  of  the  Dehomag  revolt,  and  any  manager  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">a claim to a percentage on profits. Watson possessed the ability to send a sin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gle  letter  from  his  office  that  would  reach  direcdy  into  the  bombed-out  sec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors  of  Berlin.  He  wanted  Flick  silenced  and  removed.  He  ordered  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Washington with a letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SEPTEMBER 20, 1945 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Honorable William L. Clayton </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assistant Secretary of State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington D.C. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Mr. Secretary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  have  just  received  a  letter  from  Lt.  Col.  Lawrence  G.  Flick,  who  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  leave  of  absence  from  the  International  Business  Machines  Corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ration,  in  the  Military  Service,  a  photostatic  copy  of  which  I  enclose.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  first  and  fourth  paragraphs  he  refers  to  restoring  Mr.  Karl  Hummel </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  Management.  We  do  not  want  any  of  our  IBM  people  in  the  Mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  Service  discussing  anything  of  this  kind  with  any  of  our  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">representatives  because  we  do  not  know  how  many  of  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  we  will  take  back  into  the  organization,  when  our  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">is re-instated in Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  would  like  to  have  Colonel  Flick  notified  of  this,  and  I  am  asking </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  to  advise  Mr.  H.  K.  Chauncey,  who  presents  this  letter,  as  to  how </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  matter  can  be  handled,  consistent,  of  course,  with  the  policies  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">wishes of the Military authorities in charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas J. Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">President39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  response  was  swift.  Several  days  later ,  Assistant  Secretary  of  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clayton wrote to his counterpart at the Pentagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear General Hilldring: </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  21  September  1945  Mr.  H.  K.  Chauncey,  of  the  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  Machines  Corporation,  delivered  two  letters  to  the  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  copies  of  which  are  attached  for  your  information,  which  indi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cate  that  Lt.  Colonel  Lawrence  G.  Flick,  now  on  leave  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">International  Business  Machines  Corporation  and  currendy  assigned  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">G5  Industry  Branch  in  Berlin,  is  actively  interfering  in  the  management </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  German  subsidiary  of  the  International  Business  Machines  Cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">poration.  You  will  note  that  Mr.  Thomas  J.  Watson,  President  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">International  Business  Machines  Corporation,  requests  in  his  letter  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">me  that  Lt.  Colonel  Flick  and  any  other  personnel  now  on  leave  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  International  Business  Machines  Corporation  while  in  the  military </p>
<p class="calibre1">service,  be  restrained  from  discussing  policy  with  respect  to  the  affairs </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  German  subsidiary.  I  assume  that  you  will  request  the  proper </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities to notify Colonel Flick to this effect.. .. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">William Clayton </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assistant Secretary40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clayton reported back to Watson the same day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My Dear Mr. Watson: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pursuant  to  the  suggestion  advanced  in  your  letter  of  September  20, </p>
<p class="calibre1">delivered  by  Mr.  Chauncey  to  officers  of  this  Department,  I  have  ad- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed  a  communication  to  General  Hilldring  of  the  War  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Staff,  Civil  Affairs  Division,  notifying  him  that  it  is  your  desire </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  former  employees  of  the  International  Business  Machines  Corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ration,  now  in  the  military  service,  shall  not  perform  any  actions  relat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  the  management  or  operation  of  your  German  subsidiary.  I  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">advised  General  Hilldring  that  the  Department  at  this  time  does  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">favor  the  restoration  of  private  business  connections  or  relations  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  firms  by  persons  who  are  or  claim  to  be  acting  for  the  benefit </p>
<p class="calibre1">of principals located in the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">William Clayton </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assistant Secretary41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  mid-November  Major  General  Hilldring  at  the  Pentagon  Forwarded </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  copy  of  Watson's  letter  directly  to  Gen.  Lucius  Clay,  Deputy  Military  Gover- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor  in  Berlin.  This  prompted  a  full  army  brass  investigation  of  Flick's  well- </p>
<p class="calibre1">intentioned  actions.  By  November  19,  General  Clay  had  completed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">investigation.  On  November  27,  1945,  Hilldring  reported  back  to  the  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  "Lt.  Colonel  Flick  is  being  returned  to  the  United  States  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">retirement  from  the  Army.  Therefore,  General  Clay  has  recommended  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">no further action is necessary."42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag,  the  Berlin  company  so  integral  to  the  Hitler  war  machine, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  never  treated  as  an  enemy  entity.  It  was  welcomed  back  as  a  precious </p>
<p class="calibre1">American interest and still under the control of Thomas J. Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RECAPTURING  DEHOMAG  was  a  long,  involved  process  that  began  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">days  of  Germany's  surrender.  On  May  18,  1945,  IBM  NY  sent  three  letters </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  State  Department's  War  Problems  Division.  The  first  explained  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  owned  a  company  called  Dehomag  that  installed  equipment  around </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Certainly,  much  of  that  machinery  had  been  moved  in  the  last  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Third  Reich.  IBM  wanted  State  Department  help  in  locating  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  of  those  devices.  "From  January  1937,"  IBM's  letter  claimed,  "Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  failed  to  give  us  detailed  information  of  installations  in  Germany.  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  we  do  not  know  the  exact  location  of  the  machines.  We  attach </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  list  of  the  places  in  which  at  one  time  we  knew  machines  were  located." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  two-column  list  itemized  eighty-eight  German  cities  and  towns  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holleriths  had  been  installed.  The  statement  about  not  knowing  addresses </p>
<p class="calibre1">since 1937 was made in spite of IBM's assistance in preparing the Civil Guide, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  included  up-to-date  addresses  as  of  1944  on  numerous  key  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">installations.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company's  second  letter  to  the  War  Problems  Division  included  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">addresses  of  two  residential  properties  that  had  been  managed  by  IBM's  tax </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney.  IBM  wanted  the  rents.  "He  has,  no  doubt,  accumulated  a  substan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tial amount of money for the rentals of the buildings."44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  third  letter  just  reminded  the  State  Department  that  by  immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">establishing  communications  with  Dehomag,  a  list  of  the  precise  locations  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">shifted equipment could be obtained.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  thereafter,  the  State  Department  sent  instructions  to  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign  service  officers  in  Germany  and  Austria  to  "extend  such  protection  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">may be possible to the property."46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On October 24, 1945, Chauncey returned triumphandy to Germany to </p>
<p class="calibre1">reclaim Dehomag. The  setting was quite different from his last visit. Then, in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941, he never knew from moment to moment whether he would run afoul </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Nazi Party. Now he was in the company of victors.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey's  journey  began  in  liberated  France,  where  the  U.S.  Army </p>
<p class="calibre1">assigned  Capt.  Philip  Kober  as  his  escort.  The  two  men  traveled  to  Frankfurt </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  another  escort,  Capt.  Philip  Hayter,  joined  them.  Their  first  stop  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's Frankfurt office. As he entered the property, Chauncey was abundantly </p>
<p class="calibre1">cautious  in  his  demeanor.  General  Eisenhower  had  decreed  strict  "non-frat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernization,"  forbidding  such  common  courtesies  as  shaking  hands  with  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mans,  engaging  in  friendly  conversation,  or  visiting  in  German  homes.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  adapt  to  any  geo-political  setting.  When  the  rule  was  banquets  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">social  graces,  the  company  could  summon  up  corporate  celebrations  and  par- </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  of  festive  extravangazas  at  a  moment's  notice.  Now  under  strictures  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">cold  communication,  IBM  could  exhibit  regulation  chilliness.  In  that  vein, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  visibly  asked  his  military  escorts'  permission  before  conversing </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  anyone,  spoke  only  in  the  presence  of  officers,  and  even  declined  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">look  at  papers  unless  cleared  in  advance.  After  first  obtaining  permission  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">speak  to  IBM's  Frankfurt  manager,  Chauncey,  in  a  dispassionate,  formal  tone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">requested  a  complete  list  of  financial  data  on  the  office.  Little  more  was  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cussed with the Dehomag manager.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Frankfurt,  the  trio  traveled  the  next  day  to  Stuttgart,  hoping  to  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">spect  the  vital  Dehomag  factory  in  nearby  Sindelfingen.  In  Stuttgart,  Chaun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cey first met with Maj. J. M. Teasdale, the U.S. officer in charge of Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  commercial  property  in  the  area.  When  Chauncey  asked  if  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  any  existing  procedure  for  an  American  company  to  regain  control  of  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">property,  Teasdale  replied  that  none  yet  existed.  But  if  it  would  help,  Teas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dale  offered  to  make  Chauncey  the  custodian.  He  explained  that  if  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted  the  custodianship,  he  would  be  functioning  not  in  IBM's  interest  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  as  in  the  army's  interest.  Chauncey  was  not  receptive,  feeling,  "I  think </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  unwise  for  any  IBM  man  to  be  in  charge."  In  any  event,  Teasdale  declared </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  would  not  permit  any  German  to  continue  working  for  an  American  firm </p>
<p class="calibre1">against the American company's wishes. That included Dehomag.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's  more,  there  was  business  to  be  done.  The  U.S.  military  needed </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  Hollerith  alphabetizers  in  France  and  Germany.  The  army  was  prepared </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  sign  leases  for  equipment.  Teasdale  declared  he  was  more  than  willing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">permit  Dehomag  to  fill  those  orders.  He  then  assigned  a  field  investigator, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Private Schufert, to accompany Chauncey and his escorts to Sindelfingen.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  Sindelfingen  plant  was  undamaged.  No  bombs  had  struck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey and the three military men were met by Oskar Hoermann. Taut and </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfriendly, Chauncey informed Hoermann be would not converse with him </p>
<p class="calibre1">except  with  the  permission  and  w i t h i n   earshot  of  "the  Army  people...  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">panying  me."  Having  been  authorized  to  speak,  Chauncey  stated  that  the  army </p>
<p class="calibre1">wished  IBM  to  recover  the  Holleriths  the  German  Army  had  removed  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">France.  Hoermann  replied,  as  Chauncey  noted  in  his  report,  that  "Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  little  information,  since  the  taking  of  the  machines  was  done  by  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Army  and  not  with  the  cooperation  of  Dehomag."  Ironically,  few  knew </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  about  those  transferred  machines  than  Hoermann.  Hoermann,  of  course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  deputy  Nazi  custodian  of  CEC,  the  key  Dehomag  engineering  manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  charge  of  French  equipment,  and  aware  of  page  after  page  of  CEC  billing </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands  on  the  Reich.  What's  more,  Hoermann  functioned  as  the  intermedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ary  between  CEC  and  the  MB  as  Fellinger  negotiated  and  finalized  all  308 </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine-specific lease contracts. Chauncey did not correct Hoermann.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,  Chauncey  merely  went  on  to  the  next  order  of  business.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Army,  said  Chauncey,  was  anxious  to  obtain  German-made  alphabetizes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">especially  the  advanced  D11-A.  Hoermann  replied  that  although  five  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  were  placed  into  production,  only  one  was  fully  assembled  and  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation—the  machine  used  at  Dachau.  Then  in  the  presence  of  two  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  escorts  and  an  army  field  investigator,  Chauncey  inspected  the  Dachau </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine.  It  was  partially  dismanded.  He  noticed  that  the  device,  which  fea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tured  a  rotary  printing  mechanism,  seemed  larger  than  the  Model  405  Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  alphabetizer.  Hoermann  asserted  that  the  Dachau  machine  never  worked </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well  as  it  should.  Captains  Kober  and  Hayter  also  examined  the  device.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting  back  to  IBM  NY  about  the  D11-A,  Chauncey  wrote,  "This  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  used  at  Dachau,  but  was  sent  to  the  Dehomag  at  Sindelfingen  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cooperation  of  Mr.  Hendricks."  Sergeant  Hendricks  was  a  U.S.  Army  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dustry liaison that headed up "a special installation" at Bad Nauheim.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Chauncey  turned  to  leave,  the  gregarious  Hoermann  tried  to  ask </p>
<p class="calibre1">several  questions  about  his  IBM  friends.  He  had  openly  corresponded  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">them during the war years. But Chauncey stiffly cut him off, asserting that no </p>
<p class="calibre1">personal  conversation  or  other  pleasantries  could  be  exchanged.  Hoermann </p>
<p class="calibre1">demurred.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  day,  the  group  returned  to  Frankfurt  where  they  met  with  Hen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dricks,  who  had  just  returned  from  Berlin.  Hendricks  had  inspected  the  dam- </p>
<p class="calibre1">aged Lichterfelde facility, and was carrying an envelope for IBM containing a </p>
<p class="calibre1">full  report  from  the  German  staff  there.  Lieutenant  Colonel  Flick  had  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">veyed  the  report  to  Hendricks.  In  the  awkward  moment  that  followed,  Hen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dricks  pulled  the  envelope  out  of  his  pocket,  but  Chauncey  declined  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually accept it. Instead, Chauncey immediately handed the envelope— </p>
<p class="calibre1">without looking inside, to Captain Kober standing next to him. Kober, who </p>
<p class="calibre1">read  German,  skimmed  the  reports  and  then  granted  permission  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  to  review  it  as  well.  Chauncey  did  so,  but  quickly  realized  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">reports "convey no information not previously known."54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks  told  Chauncey  some  additional  information  about  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers.  Rottke's  imprisonment  by  the  Russians  for  Nazi  connections  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  a  lost  cause  because  Mrs.  Rottke  was  known  for  pronounced  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">views.  But  Hummel  was  back.  After  Hummel  was  released  from  the  Allied </p>
<p class="calibre1">prison  at  Bad  Kreuznach,  Hendricks  saw  no  harm  in  transporting  him  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stuttgart  in  a  truck.55  Even  though  Watson  had  wanted  Hummel  excised,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had already been restored to the company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  30,  1945,  Chauncey  returned  under  escort  to  Paris  to  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinue  the  methodical  process  of  reclaiming  the  German  subsidiary.  He  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinued  to  petition  various  offices  of  the  occupying  authorities  in  Europe  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  State  Department  in  Washington.  Even  though  a  complete  policy  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">resumption  of  corporate  control  had  not  yet  been  defined,  as  soon  as  any  ad </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoc  element  of  the  policy  was  espoused,  IBM  was  ready  to  swiftly  act  on  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  late  summer  and  fall  1945,  the  bureaucratic  barriers  gradually  began </p>
<p class="calibre1">to crumble.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Berlin  and  Sindelfingen  operations  were  administered  as  two  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinct entities. During the summer, the military had initially appointed Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manager  H.  Beckmann  as  custodian  of  the  Berlin  operation.  But  he  was  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tremely  inefficient  and  depressed  over  Germany's  fortunes.  His  son  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">killed  in  the  war.  His  wife  had  her  teeth  knocked  out  during  an  altercation </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Russian  soldiers.  Chauncey  called  Beckmann  "a  broken  man."  What's </p>
<p class="calibre1">more,  he  was  on  bad  terms  with  Fellinger.  Beckmann  ordered  guards  to  stop </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellinger at the gate. Fellinger complained. So the military replaced Beckmann </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  another  Dehomag  manager,  W  Cimbal,  who  was  more  to  Fellinger's  lik- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing.  Whoever  was  appointed  to  run  Dehomag  was  dependent  upon  Fellinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  transitional  help.  After  all,  Fellinger  had  been  effectively  running  the  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries  since  1943.  Nonetheless,  occupation  authorities,  overlooking  Fellin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ger's Nazi Party connections, designated him a special advisor to Cimbal.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  IBM  had  not  regained  control  of  Dehomag,  the  company  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">now  allowed  to  resume  its  normal  operations  as  quickly  as  possible.  Consid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erable  monies  were  still  frozen  in  bank  accounts.  An  August  1945  review  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ported  that  salaries  had  not  been  paid  since  the  fall  of  Berlin.  So  Cimbal </p>
<p class="calibre1">rallied  Lichterfelde's  resources,  cut  expenses  and  salaries,  and  re-established </p>
<p class="calibre1">monthly  leasing  patterns.  To  earn  extra  cash,  toys  were  produced  from  scrap </p>
<p class="calibre1">metal. Soon Lichterfelde's tabulators were rattling again. Punch cards were </p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling  off  the  presses.  By  September  1945,  more  than  320  prior  German  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stallations  were  in  operation,  including  Holleriths  at  public  utilities,  insur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ance  companies,  and  railroads.  One  plant  filling  card  orders  for  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  U.S.  armies  was  already  at  75  percent  capacity;  it  had  produced  58  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion  cards  from  September  to  November.  A  military  order  for  17  million  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting  to  be  produced.  Cimbal  was  compelled  to  seek  IBM  NY  permission </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  order  $12,000  in  additional  machine  tools  to  restart  the  manufacturing </p>
<p class="calibre1">program.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  end  of  the  year,  Chauncey  would  be  able  to  report  in  a  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Watson,  "Cimbal  has  done  a  good  job.  The  territory  under  him  is  operat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  on  a  cash  basis  profit.  You  know  already  of  their  manufacture  of  toy9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  scrap  and  novelties  from  American  Army  discarded  tin  cans.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">rentals, however, remain the backbone of the revenue."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  August  1945,  the  military  instructed  Fellinger  to  prepare  comprehen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sive  reports  on  his  command  of  IBM  subsidiaries  in  Germany,  Norway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  Yugoslavia,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Poland,  as  well  as  his  knowledge  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  territories.  In  addition  to  a  resume  of  activities,  Fellinger  was  required </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  forecast  the  prospects  for  each  division.  Fellinger  addressed  some  reports </p>
<p class="calibre1">direcdy  to  Watson.  But  most  of  the  surveys  were  formally  submitted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  military  government  for  IBM's  review.60  These  extensive  country- </p>
<p class="calibre1">by-country  summaries,  backed  up  by  financial  data,  contained  most  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information IBM NY needed to resume control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  after  the  submission,  an  unidentified  branch  of  the  military </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested Fellinger.61 That was end of his involvement with IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  December  3,  1945,  the  American  military  government  in  Stuttgart </p>
<p class="calibre1">passed a message for Chauncey through an army office in Paris. Firm policies </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  still  unresolved  on  restoring  American  property.  But  Chauncey  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">again travel to Germany to resume discussions.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day,  December  4,  Chauncey  and  another  IBM  officer,  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warrin,  flew  from  Paris  to  an  airport  near  Frankfurt.  The  late  connecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">flight  to  Berlin  was  canceled  due  to  poor  weather.  They  tried  again  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">morning,  but  the  weather  was  unimproved.  While  waiting  in  Frankfurt,  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">again  called  on  Captain  Hayter,  who  asked  IBM  to  prepare  whatever  contract </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  deemed  appropriate  to  allow  the  military  to  begin  the  widespread  leasing </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  needed  Dehomag  machines  and  secure  repair  services  for  mobile  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines in the area.63 Chauncey was happy to comply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  weather  still  difficult,  Chauncey  and  Warrin  resorted  to  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">overnight  train.  Purchasing  tickets  at  the  last  minute,  they  were  required  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">travel all the way to Berlin in regular seats instead of first-class berths. Once </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Berlin,  they  sought  out  Major  Curry  at  the  local  Property  Control  Office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  authorized  Chauncey  to  f i n a l l y   inspect  the  Lichterfelde  facility.  No  escort </p>
<p class="calibre1">would be necessary and any useful discussion could take place.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Chauncey  and  Warrin  arrived  at  Lichterfelde,  December  6,  1945, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  American  flag  was  flying  atop  the  Dehomag  factory  roof.  They  were  met </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Cimbal  and  a  delegation  of  Dehomag  employees.  From  the  outset, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  announced,  as  before,  no  "friendly  discussion"  could  take  place, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but only an exchange of business information required by IBM NY.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day,  Chauncey  received  a  message  to  come  to  Cimbal's  home </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  speak  to  Major  Curry.  That  evening,  Chauncey  and  Warrin  arrived  at  Cim- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bal's  home  as  requested,  and  met  Curry.  But  when  they  walked  in  a  bit  fur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther,  they  saw  a  beautifully  set  dinner  table.  It  was  nothing  like  the  grandiose </p>
<p class="calibre1">banquets  IBM  had  staged  during  the  war,  but  Mrs.  Cimbal  had  spent  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  trying  to  be  hospitable  with  the  little  they  had.  Abruptly,  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped  and  harshly  demanded  that  no  party-like  atmosphere  could  ensue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adhering  to  a  strict  non-fraternization  ethic,  he  insisted  only  business  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">business-like setting could be discussed.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  then,  Lieutenant  Colonel  Flick  entered  the  dining  room.  In  a  few </p>
<p class="calibre1">days,  Flick  was  due  to  return  home.  But  for  now  he  was  still  in  authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  berated  both  Chauncey  and  Warrin  for  their  unfriendly  attitude  toward </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Cimbals.  At  that,  Chauncey  retorted:  had  he  known  he  was  being  invited </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  party,  he  would  have  refused.  The  two  IBM  men  turned  around  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">abrupdy left.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  first  checking  with  several  ranking  occupation  officers,  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">softened  his  manner  with  Cimbal.  In  subsequent  contacts,  he  was  able  to  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tract  the  key  information  about  Dehomag's  Berlin  operation,  including  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  list,  financial  condition,  a  review  of  blocked  bank  accounts,  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prospects  for  profitable  continuation.  Eventually,  he  learned  that  the  Sindel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fingen  plant  alone  had  produced  some  $3.07  million  in  cards  and  equipment </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  war  years.  One  site  alone,  Plant  II,  averaged  39  million  cards  per </p>
<p class="calibre1">month.  At the cessation of hostilities, the  Berlin factory  controlled about  1,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">total  installations,  representing  as  many  as  6,000  machines,  worth  $2.34  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion.  Some  1,314  punches,  verifiers,  sorters,  and  tabulators  were  damaged  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">user sites, representing an approximate loss to IBM of $1.61 million.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  machines  were  located  throughout  what  had  been  known  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Greater  Reich  and  adjacent  occupied  territories.  In  Poland:  444  punches </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  verifiers,  144  sorters,  124  tabulators,  and  74  auxiliary  machines.  In  Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tria:  447  punches  and  verifiers,  117  sorters,  91  tabulators,  and  53  auxiliary </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines. In Czechoslovakia: 108 punches and verifiers, 37 sorters, 26 tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lators,  and  17  auxiliary  machines.  All  tolled,  some  2,348  Holleriths  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified for recovery.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  sought  out  IBM  attorney  Heinrich  Albert.  Albert  was  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">functioning  as  custodian  for  Ford  Motor  Company's  operation  in  Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  many  of  the  records  relating  to  Dehomag  were  lost,  Albert  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">able  to  sign  enough  affidavits  and  certificates  to  document  that  IBM  NY  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">in fact the lawful owner of Dehomag and all its Holleriths.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine  by  machine,  office  by  office,  IBM  NY  began  recouping  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeds  of  Dehomag's  service  to  the  Third  Reich.  In  doing  so,  the  utmost </p>
<p class="calibre1">care  was  taken  to  walk  the  thin  green  line  between  conquest  and  commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  summarized  his  own  conduct  in  a  report  to  New  York.  Uppermost </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  his  mind,  was  the  "desire  that  neither  I  nor  IBM  should  be  in  any  way </p>
<p class="calibre1">criticized."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  was  completely  successful.  Endless  additional  meetings  ensued </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  many  transient  bureaucratic  faces  of  what  was  known  as  OMGUS </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Office of the Military Governor-U.S.), as well as its counterparts in the Russian </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupying  administration.  IBM  was  cautious,  persistent,  and  consistendy  above </p>
<p class="calibre1">reproach. This  perception was  indispensable  because  with the  horror  of  6  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion  murdered  Jews,  and  perhaps  an  equal  number  of  other  Europeans,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  billions  of  dollars,  francs,  and  crowns  in  plunder  and  devastation,  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">crime  trials  were  being  organized.  Reparations  from  the  German  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">sector were being readied. IBM very much wanted to be excluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MILITARY LAW NO. 52 was a problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Article  I  stated:  "All  property  in  occupied  territory  is  subject  to  seizure </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  possession  or  tide  of  management,  supervision  or  otherwise,  which  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">owned  or  controlled  in  any  way  by:  (a)  The  German  Reich  or  any  sub  divi- </p>

<p class="calibre1">...  or  its  agencies;  (d)  persons  held  by  Military  Government  under  deten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion."  Dehomag  qualified  on  all  accounts.  It  was  controlled  by  known  Nazis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  and  Rottke,  who  also  owned  10  percent  of  the  shares.  Rottke  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel  had  been  arrested  for  their  Nazi  affiliations.  The  company's  Board </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Directors  since  1941  was  completely  Nazified.  As  part  of  the  war  machin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ery,  Dehomag  was  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">wartime agency.72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  had  reviewed  a  summary  of  Military  Law  No.  52  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allied decrees as early as May 21, 1945.73 IBM sought to be carved out of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  sphere  of  culpability  and  absorbed  into  the  apparatus  of  victory.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted r e s t i t u t i o n  for its war-damaged property, not to become a candidate </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  reparations.  IBM  did  not  want  to  join  the  roster  of  all  those  deemed  part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  what  was  termed  "Nazi  conspiracy  and  aggression."  Fortunately  for  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  seemed  to  be  a  concerted  effort  to  keep  Watson  and  the  company  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the reparations discourse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  16,  when  Assistant  Secretary  of  State  Clayton  first  wrote  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Pentagon  about  the  troublesome  Lieutenant  Colonel  Flick  and  Dehomag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  third  paragraph  originally  referred  to  the  issue  of  potential  reparations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As  you  know,"  Clayton  initially  asserted,  "this  Government's  policy  towards </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  reparations,  external  assets,  and  combines  is  not  fully  implemented </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  it  is  my  belief  that  for  these  and  other  reasons  it  is  undesirable  at  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  to  foster  or  support  the  restoration  of  private  business  relationships." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  a  State  Department  policy  review  of  the  proposed  draft  objected  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">paragraph.  "Attached  is  a  redraft  version  of  the  Clayton-Hilldring  letter  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cerning the activities of Lt. Colonel Flick," wrote "Walt Rostow. "As you will </p>
<p class="calibre1">note,  I  have  simply  removed  the  offending  paragraph."  A  large  X  was  drawn </p>
<p class="calibre1">across the draft, and a shorter version mailed.74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  Chauncey's  first  post-war  visit  to  occupied  Stuttgart,  in  October </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945,  Major  Teasdale  indicated  that  all  the  corporate  enterprises  in  the  heav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ily  industrial  Sindelfingen  area  were  slated  to  be  liquidated  for  reparations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey's  report  back  to  New  York  confirmed,  "He  [Major  Teasdale]  stated </p>
<p class="calibre1">that all of the property in the American zone belongs to the American govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  for  reparations,  and  that  if  and  when  property  owned  by  an  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  turned  over  to  him,  it  would  reduce  the  reparation  claim  of  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States and consequendy the reparation claim of the American owner."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  his  second  trip,  Chauncey  arranged  for  a  personal  visit  to  Deputy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Military  Governor  Clay's  office  where  he  was  introduced  to  General  Clay's </p>
<p class="calibre1">assistant,  Gen.  William  Draper.  Draper,  a  friend  of  Watson's,  headed  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">OMGUS'  Economic  Branch.  Draper,  in  turn,  introduced  Chauncey  to  Col. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John  A.  Allen,  the  man  in charge  of the  Restitution Branch.  Chauncey  argued </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  case  "that  the  American  viewpoint  would  be  the  restoration  of  Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can-owned  concerns  to  their  owners,  and  that  it  would  not  be  .  .  .  that  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">companies  would  be  used  for  general  reparations,  as  has  been  proposed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey was told that no decision had yet been formulated.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  view  held  that  even  if  their  machinery  and  corporate  acumen  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  organize  and  optimize  the  Third  Reich's  aggression,  they  should  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">held  exempt—ipso  facto—by  virtue  of  its  American  ownership.  The  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">contended that its Nazi payments were protected revenues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  prevailing  thought  among  the  Allies  and  those  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded  justice  was  that  all  in  government  and  the  private  sector  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  Hitler  destroy  Europe  and  commit  genocide  should  be  held  account- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able  in  war  crimes.  Their  war  gains  and  economic  wherewithal  were  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrosanct.  Rather,  they  should  be  sacrificed  as  reparations  to  the  victims— </p>
<p class="calibre1">nations  and  individuals  both.  Whether  dressed  in  jackboots  and  swastikas,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">suit  and  tie,  accountability  was  demanded.  Indeed,  the  world  understood </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  corporate  collusion  was  the  keystone  to  Hitler's  terror.  Businessmen  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperated  with  Hitler  were  considered  to  be  war  criminals  or  "accessories </p>
<p class="calibre1">to war crimes."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">OMGUS  established  a  Division  of  Investigation  of  Cartels  and  External </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assets  to  identify  those  responsible  for  the  financing  and  corporate  support </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Nazi  Germany.  By  November  1,  1945,  twenty-one  major  bankers  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested  for  their  role  in  helping  German  rearmament  and  the  plunder  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied  nations.  Twenty  more  bankers  were  targeted.  The  financial  institu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  identified  included  Germany's  most  respected:  Deutsche  Bank,  Dresd- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner Bank, and Commerzbank.78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  magnates  from  the  steel,  finance,  automotive,  and  chemical </p>
<p class="calibre1">industries  were  also  arrested  and  sent  to  the  Nuremberg  dock.  Names  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  Krupp,  Thyssen,  and  Flick  became  synonymous  with  corporate  war  crimi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nality.  Even  companies  with  American  ownership  or  affiliation  were  spot- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lighted. For example Roehm &amp; Haas of Darmstadt was investigated. The firm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  manufactured  Plexiglas  bulletproof  materials  in  Germany,  was  affili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  with  its  American-owned  counterpart  in  Philadelphia.  Each  of  the  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate  twins  was  half-owned  by  German  and  American  citizens.  The  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  Times  reported,  "Files  located  in  Darmstadt  reveal  the  history  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">joint  efforts  of  the  German  Roehm  &amp;  Haas  and  the  American  Roehm  &amp;  Haas </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  nullify  the  action  of  the  Alien  Property  Custodian  and  restore  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">interest in the American firm."79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  January  5,  1946,  hundreds  of  German  factories  were  slated  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">sold to Americans to effect reparations. These factories covered a range of in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dustry  from  entrenched  armament  firms,  such  as  the  Borgward  torpedo  plant </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Bremen,  to  Norddeutsche  Dernierwerke's  factory  number  4  at  Rothebeck, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  manufactured  simple  household  utensils  and  beds.80  They  were  sold </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  because  they  represented  economic  assets  of  the  German  people  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">liquidated in war culpability, and because they were war vendors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  another  week,  OMGUS  had  destroyed  or  liquidated  half  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">I.G.  Farben's  forty-two  German  plants.  Two  dozen  of  its  directors  and  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate managers were indicted on five war crimes. One count specified "the </p>
<p class="calibre1">planning, preparation, initiation and waging of wars and invasions of other </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries."  A  second  identified  "crimes  against  humanity  through  participat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  in  the  enslavement  and  deportation  for  slave  labor  of  civilians."  A  third </p>
<p class="calibre1">count  accused  the  executives  of  "participation  in  a  common  plan  or  conspir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">acy  to  commit  crimes  against  peace."  Ten  of  the  defendants  were  acquitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  remainder  were  found  guilty  and  sentenced  to  varying  terms  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">prison.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  fall  1946,  the  Allies  had  selected  658  German  plants  to  be  liquidated </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  reparations:  157  in  the  American  zone,  444  in  the  British  zone,  and  57  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  French  zone.  Only  half  of  the  firms  were  from  the  war  industry.  Russia </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  already  received  15,500  tons  of  commercial  deliveries  as  part  of  its  repa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rations levy.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Belgium,  prosecutors  tried  industrialists  for  commercial  cooperation </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  Reich.  Defendants  included  a  textile  company  executive,  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">financiers.  All  revenues  received  from  Nazi  Germany  were  confiscated; </p>
<p class="calibre1">prison  sentences  ranged  from  four  to  eight  years.  Newspapers  reported  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Belgian  court's  declaration  that  the  executives  had  embarked  upon  a  "two- </p>
<p class="calibre1">way  gamble  designed  to  pay  rich  dividends  either  way—if  Hitler  won  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war or lost it."83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Justice  Robert  H.  Jackson,  chief  Nuremberg  prosecutor,  told  Armed </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forces  Radio  that  he  feared  that  while  German  industrialists  were  "one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  chief  causes  of  the  war,"  most  would  never  be  brought  to  justice.  Jack- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  fellow  prosecutors  felt  the  number  of  defendants  would  simply  be  too </p>
<p class="calibre1">large  to  pragmatically  try  in  the  first  wave  of  Nuremberg  Trials.  The  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allied  prosecutors  suggested  that  perhaps  businessmen  could  be  indicted </p>
<p class="calibre1">later.  "I  feared  failure  to  include  them,"  said  Jackson,  "would  mean  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">never would be tried. Time only will tell which was right."84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  trial  process  was  slowed  by  the  necessity  of  translating  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents,  exhibits,  and  testimony  into  several  languages  of  the  war  crime </p>
<p class="calibre1">tribunal:  French,  Russian,  German,  and  English.  Justice  Jackson  turned  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">newly  invented  process  called  "simultaneous  translation."  One  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewed  all  the  evidence  and  translated  it  not  only  for  real  time  usage  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">trial  proceedings,  but  for  posterity.  That  company  was  International  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines.  It  made  the  final  translated  record  of  all  evidence  back  and  forth </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  French,  Russian,  German,  Polish,  and  English.  Watson  offered  to  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">take the massive evidence handling free of charge.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  wealthy  men  stood  in  the  dock  at  Nuremberg.  Publishers,  finan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ciers,  bankers,  and  industrialists  were  summoned  to  account  for  their  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">merce. Hjalmar Schacht himself, former president of the Reichsbank and out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of power for years although ultimately acquitted, was forced to explain his </p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement at the bar of justice.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  was  a  far  different  story  for  IBM.  It  seemed  to  be  immune  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  debate  itself.  Every  bloodstain  and  barracks  blueprint  in  the  camps  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">examined,  catalogued,  and  probed.  Machines  such  as  Dachau's  D11-A, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inspected  by  Chauncey,  and  those  at  Auschwitz,  Buchenwald,  Westerbork, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  at  the  Warsaw  Ghetto,  were  simply  recovered  and  resorbed  into  the  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">asset  list.  They  would  be  deployed  another  day,  another  way,  for  another </p>
<p class="calibre1">client.  No  answers  or  explanations  would  be  provided.  Questions  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's Holleriths were never even raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM WAS MORE than important to the Allies. It was vital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Supreme  Headquarters  Allied  Expeditionary  Force  (SHAEF)  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Allied  high  command  in  Europe  under  General  Eisenhower.  SHAEF  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">established a classified statistical analysis office in Bad Nauheim, which in sum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mer  1945  was  serving  the  United  States  Strategic  Bombing  Survey  (USSBS). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt  had  established the  Bombing  Survey  in  November  1944  to  evaluate </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  devastating  effects  of  Allied  bombing  on  Germany.  This  was  to  include </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  effects  of  civilian  morale  and  whether  bombs  hardened  the  national  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">to fight, or collapsed it.87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bad  Nauheim  site  was  completely  dependent  upon  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  and  Dehomag  operators  for  its  numerous  calculations  of  bomb </p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction  and  predictions  of  the  resulting  social  disruption.  The  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morale  Division,  staffed  with  a  platoon  of  social  scientists,  psychologists,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">economists  relied  upon  the  machines  to  quantify  public  reaction  to  severe </p>
<p class="calibre1">bombing.  Regular  debriefing  of  civilians  and  experienced  Gestapo  agents </p>
<p class="calibre1">regarding  the  dimensions  of  political  dissension,  as  well  as  survey  question- </p>
<p class="calibre1">naires, were all reduced to researchable punch card data.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  USSBS  was  denied  nothing.  When  its  officers  asked  for  one  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith,  eight  sets  were  flown  overnight  from  the  United  States  to  London,  along </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  staff  needed  to  operate  them;  from  London,  the  units  were  rushed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Bad Nauheim. "When another USSBS statistical office at Jena needed to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">evacuated  before  being  absorbed  into  the  Russian  zone,  a  convoy  of  trucks </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  immediately  provided  to  transfer  all  the  punch  cards,  machines,  and  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man technicians in a single move.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  man  who  made  the  Holleriths  run  at  Bad  Nauheim  was  Sergeant </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks.  Hendricks  was  the  same  man  who  transferred  the  D-11A  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dachau to Dehomag's Sindelfingen plant. He was also the man who drove </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel from his prison release to Stuttgart. In Bad Nauheim, Hendricks </p>
<p class="calibre1">had the knowledge and expertise to convert the prior Hol lerit h installation of </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  former  Reich  industry  association  into  a  pure  USSBS  operation.  Hendricks </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  sure  a  continuous  stream  of  army  questionnaires  on  economic  capacity </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  methodically  processed  by  a  range  of  industries  in  occupied  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  this  way,  the  Allies  could  assess  the  ability  of  German  industry  to  recover </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  massive  bombing  it  had  endured.  The  system  was  identical  to  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  by  the  MB  when  it  monitored  industrial  output  during  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">era. Hendricks even used the same forms.90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  30,  1945,  a  group  from  the  Planning  and  Intelligence  Branch  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">SHAEFs  Economic  Division,  led  by  a  Brigadier  General,  visited  the  Bad </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nauheim  facility.  Three  days  later,  the  Brigadier  General  reported  on  his  visit </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hendricks'  indispensable  value.  "[T]he  party  was  shown  round  by  Sgt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks,"  the  General  wrote,  "in  civilian  life  an  employee  of  the  Interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  Business  Machines  Company,  who  are  the  patentees  of  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">system.  Sgt.  Hendricks  has  supervised  a  number  of  installations  on  behalf  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  firm,  and  is  obviously  a  competent  technician  in  this  particular  field."  At </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bad  Nauheim,  the  General  wrote,  Sergeant  Hendricks  was  supervising  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">sixty  "carefully  screened  German  personnel"  operating  fourteen  sorters,  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulators,  and  a  host  of  punchers  and  verifiers.  Hendricks  told  the  tour </p>
<p class="calibre1">group, the report noted, "There was practically no limit to the information ob- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tainable through the Hollerith system, provided the right questions were asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">at the outset." In the General's original report, the words were underlined.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  August  2,  1945,  tour  report  noted  that  Hendricks  was  scheduled  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">complete  the  USSBS's  last  economic  surveys  on  August  4.  Then  the  unit's </p>
<p class="calibre1">job  in  Germany  would  be  finished.  The  USSBS  was  scheduled  to  leave  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">facility on August 15, the note explained.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  its  inception,  a  stated  mission  of  the  USSBS  was  to  apply  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">bombing  impact  information  compiled  in  Germany  to  America's  air  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  Japan.  On  August  6,  a  U.S.  bomber  dropped  an  atomic  bomb  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hiroshima.  Three  days  later,  Nagasaki  was  bombed.  USSBS  statistical  analy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ses  and  predictions  of  economic  and  social  ruination  had  been  part  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">decision-making  process.  On  August  15,  President  Harry  Truman  instructed </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  USSBS  to  begin  evaluating  the  effects  of  America's  atomic  bombing  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan.  Anticipating  the  order,  the  statistic  team  had  already  departed  Bad </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nauheim. They left all their Hollerith equipment behind.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  best-equipped  punch  card  center  in  occupied  Germany,  Sergeant </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks assured that with the USSBS gone, the Bad Nauheim location could </p>
<p class="calibre1">serve all industrial data needs in the American zone. Sergeant Hendricks </p>
<p class="calibre1">added  that  a  similar  data  facility  could  be  erected  for  the  British  zone.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">th e i r   part,  the  Russians  in  their  zone  were  already  utilizing  the  experienced </p>
<p class="calibre1">staff  and  IBM  machinery  of  the  Reich  Statistical  Office  in  Berlin.94  There  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">no need for the American and British to have anything less. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  industrial  statistics  were  only  the  beginning.  When  occupying  au- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thorities  needed  a  census  of  all  Germans  in  the  territories,  they  knew  whom </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  call.  Dehomag  stepped  forward.  The  company's  census  experts  simply  took </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  existing  census  tabulation  regimens  and  made  certain  adjustments  for  Allied </p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements.  Some  of  the  column  headings  were  adjusted  slightly,  but  little </p>
<p class="calibre1">else.  Columns  1-6:  unchanged.  Column  7:  Family  Status.  Column  8:  Religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Column  9:  Mother  Tongue.  Column  10:  National  Descent  (or  Ethnicity).  Col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">umn  11:  Nationality.  At  one  point  in  the  preparations  an  American  officer </p>
<p class="calibre1">complained  that  some  of  the  German  column  headings  requesting  ethnicity </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  "of  Nazi  memory  and  implying  a  racial  idea  which  was  most  undesir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able." Eventually, however, American objections subsided.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Russians  permitted  the  Reich  Statistical  Office,  controlled  in  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">zone,  to  help  Dehomag  implement  the  project.  The  four  powers  agreed  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">completed  census  forms  would  be  destroyed  after  two  years—but  only  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  individual  information  was  transferred  to  punch  cards.  For  Dehomag,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">1946  census  of  occupation  was  a  project  organized  quickly  and  economi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cally.  People  counting  was  what  they  did  best.  The  questions  remained  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">same. Only the client name changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  1947,  it  was  time  to  change  the  subsidiary's  name  as  well.  On  July  4, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1947,  IBM's  Foreign  Trade  Vice  President  J.  T.  Wilson  wrote  to  Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Apparently  now  is  a  good  time  to  change  the  name  of  the  company  and  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">discontinue  the  name  'Hollerith.'  I  have,  therefore,  given  instructions  to  start </p>
<p class="calibre1">the necessary proceedings to call it 'IBM Germany.'96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Germany  was  emerging  from  its  occupation,  Dehomag  was  edging </p>
<p class="calibre1">back to IBM NY's dominion. The company had received permission to under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  various  contractual  agreements  with  Dehomag.  But  only  upon  formal </p>
<p class="calibre1">decontrol  would  IBM  NY  regain  genuine  custody  of  its  German  operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  meantime,  Dehomag's  financial  success  was  impressive.  By  the  end  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1946,  it  had  emerged  from  a  bombed  and  dissected  Germany  with  a  valua- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of more than RM 56.6 million and a gross profit of RM 7.5 million.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  key  toward  regaining  total  control  was  fortifying  the  argument  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  not  a  German  company,  but  an  American-owned  enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  14,  1947,  custodian  Karl  Hummel  filed  papers  with  OMGUS </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  German  financial  authorities  averring  that  the  token  German  shares  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag that he, Rottke and Heidinger owned were not genuine stock own- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ership.  "We  cannot  understand  how  our  relationship  with  our  parent  can  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  to  Law  No.  56.  .  .  .  While  a  minority  interest  exists  in  Germany,  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">minority  interest  was  granted  as  an  inducement  to  the  managers  of  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany;  but  they  are  not  shareholders  in  the  general  sense  of  the  term,  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  are  not  free  to  sell  their  shares,  but  can  sell  them  only  to  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  only  for  their  book  value.  They  were  retaining  the  share  only  during </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  holding  a  leading  position  in  the  company.  Only  one  remains  today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Heidinger  died  in  1944  and  Mr.  Rottke is reported  to  have died  in  a  Rus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sian camp."98 Ironically, the one remaining shareholder was Hummel himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  end  of  1947,  IBM  would  finally  receive  a  Treasury  License </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  repurchase  the  stock  of  Rottke,  Heidinger,  and  Hummel,  thus  regaining </p>
<p class="calibre1">100  percent  ownership  of  its  German  unit.  Ownership  still  did  not  convey </p>
<p class="calibre1">control.  It  took  two  years  of  additional  bureaucratic  wrangling  before  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  legally  change  Dehomag's  name  to  IBM  Deutschland.  That  happened </p>
<p class="calibre1">in April 1949." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  years  that  followed,  IBM's  worldwide  stature  became  even  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  a  beacon  to  the  cause  of  progress.  It  adopted  a  corporate  motto:  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solutions  Company."  Whatever  the  impossible  task,  IBM  technology  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">find  a  solution.  The  men  who  headed  up  the  IBM  enterprise  in  Nazi  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  America  became  revered  giants  within  the  corporation's  global  commu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nity.  Chauncey  became  chairman  of  the  IBM  World  Trade  Corporation,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">(he  European  subsidiary  managers  were  rewarded  for  their  loyalty  with  top </p>
<p class="calibre1">jobs.  Their  exploits  during  the  Nazi  era  were  lionized  with  amazing  specific- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity  in  a  promotional  book  entitled  The  History  of  Computing  in  Europe,  pub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lished  in  1967  by  IBM  itself.  However,  an  internal  IBM  review  decided  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  withdraw  the  book  from  the  market.  It  is  no  longer  available  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">any publicly accessible library anywhere in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  after  ceaseless  efforts,  IBM  NY  regained  control  of  its  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  subsidiary.  The  name  had  been  changed,  the  money  regained,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines recovered, the record clear. For IBM the war was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  for  the  descendants  of  6  million  Jews  and  millions  of  other  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">peans,  the  war  would  never  be  over.  It  would  haunt  them  and  people  of  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">science  forever.  After  decades  of  documentation  by  the  best  minds,  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">studied  among  them  would  confess  that  they  never  really  understood  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust  process. Why  did  it  happen?  How  could  it  happen?  How  were  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">selected? How did the Nazis get the names? They always had the names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  seemingly  magical  scheduling  process  could  have  allowed  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions  of  Nazi  victims  to  step  onto  train  platforms  in  Germany  or  nineteen </p>
<p class="calibre1">other Nazi-occupied countries, travel for two and three days by rail, and then </p>
<p class="calibre1">step onto a ramp at Auschwitz or Treblinka—and within an hour be marched </p>
<p class="calibre1">into gas chambers. Hour a f t e r  hour. Day a f t e r  day. Timetable after timetable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like clockwork, and always with blitzkrieg efficiency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  survivors  would  never  know.  The  liberators  who  fought  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">never  know.  The  politicians  who  made  speeches  would  never  know.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">prosecutors  who  prosecuted  would  never  know.  The  debaters  who  debated </p>
<p class="calibre1">would never know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The question was barely even raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTERWORD: THE NEXT CHAPTER </p>
<p class="calibre1">FROM        THE        MOMENT        IBM      AND        THE        HOLOCAUST    </p>
<p class="calibre1">APPEARED  worldwide  on  February  12,  2001,  new  information  began  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">appear,  especially  during  my  travels.  Former  IBM  employees,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">families  of  principal  players,  and  survivors  of  World  War  II  emerged </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  offer  eyewitness  testimony,  personal  documents  from  the  period, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  memoirs.  What's  more,  archivists  and  historians  began  assem- </p>

<p class="calibre1">previously </p>
<p class="calibre1">overlooked </p>

<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information </p>
<p class="calibre1">that </p>
<p class="calibre1">launched  the  book.  All  of  it  deepened  the  documentation  chroni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cling  IBM's  twelve-year  relationship  with  the  Third  Reich.  Much  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  reinforced  the  need  to  encourage  research  throughout  the  world, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to persist in connecting the dots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMANY </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information </p>
<p class="calibre1">about </p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous </p>
<p class="calibre1">German </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camps </p>
<p class="calibre1">came </p>
<p class="calibre1">to light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Berlin,  during  a  historians'  panel  at  the  Jewish  Community </p>
<p class="calibre1">Center,  I  was  approached  by  an  enthusiastic  Georgia  Peet-Tanover, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  Bulgarian  imprisoned  for  years  during  the  Nazi  regime.  I  had  actu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  spoken  to  her  by  telephone  several  times  during  my  research, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  at  last  we  were  able  to  meet.  Peet,  who  speaks  perfect  English </p>
<p class="calibre1">and maintains an impressive vitality, recalled her days as a young </p>
<p class="calibre1">girl  in  the  Ravensbruck  concentration  camp.  When  she  became  quite  ill,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp  doctor  re-assigned  her  to  "easy  work."  That  work  involved  manual </p>
<p class="calibre1">"sorting  of  cards  with  holes  punched  in  them."  There  was  no  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  in  her  unit,  just  cards  filed  in  wooden  boxes.  Peet,  as  she  calls  her- </p>
<p class="calibre1">self,  had  no  idea  what  the  cards  were  called  or  what  their  purpose  was  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">than "something to do with prisoner assignments."1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nor  did  I  care,"  she  told  me.  "I  was  just  trying  to  stay  alive."  Not  until </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peet  and  I  first  spoke  at  the  onset  of  my  research  did  she  understand  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards  were  Hollerith  cards  produced  by  IBM.  Only  then  did  she  make </p>
<p class="calibre1">the connection to the prisoner designations she was instructed to sort.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Ravensbruck  cards  Peet  and  others  sorted  were  regularly  couriered </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  central  processing  bank  for  concentration  camp  labor,  the  Zentral </p>
<p class="calibre1">Institut, on Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. Ironically, after the war, Peet settled in a </p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet  Berlin  residential  neighborhood  on  Friedrichstrasse.  It  was  only  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  book's  research  revealed  the  location  of  the  processing  center  that  Peet </p>
<p class="calibre1">realized  her  pleasant  apartment  was  in  the  very  same  building  complex  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">housed the Zentral Institut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Dachau,  the  Hollerith  installation  was  far  larger  than  first  realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  the  Holocaust  has  documented  that  in  most  camps  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  or  Abteilung  Hollerith,  was  ensconced  in  the  Arbeitseinsatz,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">is, the Labor Assignment Office, generally just an ordinary barracks. But after </p>
<p class="calibre1">publication  I  learned  that  at  Dachau,  two  dozen  Hollerith  machines  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">kept  in  a  special  two-story  reinforced-concrete  structure  known  as  "the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Bunker."  Dachau  memorial  archives  have  discovered  a  photo  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">fortified  edifice.  The  archives  also  include  a  1948  report  by  former  Dachau </p>
<p class="calibre1">survivors  reconstructing  various  work  detachments  and  the  names  of  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">supervisors  at  the  camp.  The  report  listed  fifty  leading  slave  labor  battalions </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  approximate  number  of  prisoners,  as  well  as  the  kapos  and  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">officers  in  charge.  The  list  includes  the  Political  Department:  10  prisoners; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arbeitseinsatz:  10  prisoners;  Sewing  Department:  180  prisoners;  but  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Bunker  utilized  300  prisoners.  The  1948  numbers  are  a  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">estimate  by  the  survivor  group.  However,  by  any  measure,  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation  would  have  been  one  of  the  largest  stricdy  administrative  groups </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Dachau.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike  many  structures,  the  pillbox-like  Hollerith  building  survived  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allied  bombardment  of  Germany,  and  still  stands  today  just  outside  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">remains  of  the  main  gate  of  the  camp.  Local  police  continue  to  refer  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">concrete  cube  by  its  original  name,  the  Hollerith  Bunker.4  With  so  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines needing monthly repair and ongoing maintenance, and with mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions  of  job-specific  punch  cards  required  Dehomag  technicians  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly stationed in Dachau almost continuously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Buchenwald,  where  reinforced  bunkers  had  not  yet  been  built,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">inherent  nature  of  information  technology  allowed  the  Hollerith  system  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">survive  Allied  bombardment.  No  one  is  sure  when  Buchenwald's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  was  inaugurated,  but  the  camp's  Hollerith  group  was  dubbed </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kommando 68.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allied  bombing  raids  in  August  1944  destroyed  several  buildings  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">liuchenwald,  including  the  provisional  Hollerith  office.  On  September  23, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  bureaucrats,  probably  in  Berlin,  wrote  to  camp  officers  asking  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Hollerith  files  would  be  restored.  Buchenwald's  labor  placement  leader, </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS  Captain  Albert  Schwartz,  reassured  that  the  card  files  could  be  repro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  quickly.  "[T]he  Hollerith  file  burned  completely,"  Schwartz  answered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">".  .  .  But  because  prisoners'  cards  for  Buchenwald  concentration  camp  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">already been created, a copy is available in the file of the Arbeitseinsatzfuhrer </p>
<p class="calibre1">[labor  placement  leader].  We  are  currendy  investigating  just  how  many  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">are missing . . . about 8,500 cards will have to be tediously reconstructed."6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain  Schwartz  added,  "As  labor  assignment  leader,  I  myself  have  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest  interest  in  the  reconstitution  of  the  card  file  as  soon  as  possible.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  meantime,  I  have  found  a  provisional  solution  using  data  gathered  solely </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  labor  assignments,  for  which  an  auxiliary  card  file  was  created.  However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  contains  only  number,  name  and  occupation  as  well  as  the  current  labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">brigade  assignment.  This  auxiliary  card  file  is  also  constandy  needed  in  order </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  enter  occupations  and  changes."  To  safeguard  future  operations,  Captain </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schwartz  explained,  "It  is  planned  that  the  Hollerith  card  department  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">given  a  separate  barracks  as  a  workspace.  However,  the  promised  building </p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies have not yet arrived."7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  Buchenwald's  Hollerith  operation  continued  at  quite  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">pace,  according  to  documents  just  discovered  in  the  camp's  archives  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buchenwald's  tenacious  historian  Harry  Stein.  These  documents  reveal  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  daily  fluctuations  in  the  number  of  inmates  working  in  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">unit.  On  August  18,  1944,  just  as  the  Allied  bombing  raids  started,  thirty- </p>
<p class="calibre1">three  prisoners  worked  in  Abteilung  Hollerith;  their  names  were  handwritten </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  two-column  roster  with  Prisoner  Fanczak  55/55999  being  the  last  entry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath  Fanczak's  name,  Prisoners  34/21813  and  56/42723  were  listed  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">too sick for work.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  days  later,  on  August  23,  the  Abteilung  Hollerith  workforce  increased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scribbled  tallies  began  with  fifty  prisoners,  then  subtracted  two  unavailable </p>
<p class="calibre1">for work, creating a new total of forty-eight. But later three new prisoners </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  added  to  the  detachment  -  Inmates  Susic  40/44416,  Muller  34/21756, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Cielecki  15/3988—diese  marked  on  scraps  of  departmental  notes.  Their </p>
<p class="calibre1">last  names  and  Hollerith  prisoner  numbers  were  also  the  final  entries  on  yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  handwritten  two-column  roster.  By  August  27,  the  Hollerith  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment's  roster  of  fifty  had  been  reduced  by  half  when  twenty-five  prisoners </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Buchenwald's  notorious  Little  Camp,  probably  Jewish,  had  become  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">available,  most  likely  due  to  illness  or  death.  By  the  end  of  the  month,  a  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stored  total  of  forty-eight  was  again  reduced  by  illness  or  death  in  the  Litde </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camp to a new work contingent of forty prisoners.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  17,  1944,  the  Abteilung  Hollerith  at  Ravensbruck  concen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration camp sent the Abteilung Hollerith at Buchenwald a group of Hollerith- </p>
<p class="calibre1">codable  paper  prisoner  identification  forms  and  a  Hollerith  transfer  list </p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning  five  women  transferred  to  Work  Camp  Taucha  on  November  6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cover  letter  also  complained  that  Buchenwald's  Hollerith  cards  had  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet  been  received  for  hundreds  of  prisoners  transferred  to  Ravensbriick  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">prior  weeks.  The  list  also  mentioned  244  prisoners  moved  from  Work  Camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">Torgau  on  October  5;  plus  169  prisoners  moved  from  Work  Camp  Leipzig, </p>
<p class="calibre1">128  prisoners  from  Work  Camp  Altenburg,  and  64  prisoners  from  Work </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camp  Taucha—all  on  October  13;  as  well  as  six  prisoners  from  Work  Camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leipzig on October 30; and finally, five from Work Camp Taucha on Novem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  5.  "We  again  request  that  these  file  cards  be  sent  as  quickly  as  possible," </p>
<p class="calibre1">chastised Ravensbriick, "since they are urgendy needed for new transfers."10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On </p>
<p class="calibre1">January </p>
<p class="calibre1">25, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>

<p class="calibre1">Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">Administration—the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oranienburg-based  agency  that  operated  all  camps—dispatched  a  ten-page </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  list  of  slave  laborers  deployed  in  mines  at  Buchenwald,  asking  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp to annotate each miner's current location and status.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prisoners  servicing  the  Abteilung  Hollerith  at  Buchenwald  regularly  came </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  went,  but  the  card  sorting  continued  almost  until  liberation.  In  fact,  four- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teen  prisoners  were  still  laboring  in  the  department  on  February  2,  1945.  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">then,  Prisoner  Muller  34/21756,  who  was  added  less  than  six  months  earlier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  "exited."  Thirteen  men  still  remained  hard  at  work  on  February  13, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945.12  On  April  11,  1945,  Buchenwald  was  overrun  by  Allied  troops.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">clock above the concentration camp gate was permanently stopped at 3:15 P.M., </p>
<p class="calibre1">the moment of liberation. By then, no more card sorting was possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  documents  and  accounts  have  surfaced  at  other  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp  memorial  archives,  some  of  them  obtained  from  previously  unex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ploited  records  in  recently  opened  Russian  archives.  For  example,  weekly </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Change  Reports"  were  newly  discovered  in  Russia  by  Sachsenhausen </p>
<p class="calibre1">archivist Winfried Meyer. These included 1944 Change Reports from Gross- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosen,  Hollerith-coded  5,  and  Sachsenhausen,  Hollerith-coded  II.  These </p>
<p class="calibre1">weekly  lists  of  camp-by-camp  work  assignment  changes  were  typed  or  hand- </p>
<p class="calibre1">written  on  large  codable  paper  forms,  each  column  of  the  form  preprinted </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  its  corresponding  Hollerith  column  number.  Inmate  Hollerith  numbers </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  to  be  punched  into  column  22,  work  assignments  in  column  23,  birth </p>
<p class="calibre1">dates  into  column  5,  gender  into  column  6.  Other  columns  recorded  work </p>
<p class="calibre1">skills,  such  as  carpentry,  mechanics,  or  unskilled  labor.  Two  narrow  columns </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  form  confirmed  card  issuance  upon  entering  the  camp  and  again </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  transferring  out.  Each  paper  form  featured  a  box  at  the  bottom </p>
<p class="calibre1">preprinted on the left mit H-Liste vgl, indicating "compared to Hollerith List," </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  gepruft  for  "punch  card  verified,"  and  both  were  initialed  by  the  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith operator.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally,  handwritten  status  notations  were  penned  in  German  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  entries.  One  bears  the  note  "all  changes  in  assignments  of  numbers </p>
<p class="calibre1">below  reported  in  the  Hollerith  cards."  Another  shows  the  notation  Karten  im </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lochsaal  to  indicate  "cards  in  punching  hall."14  A  Lochsaal,  or  "punching  hall" </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  large  Hollerith  operation  generally  involving  more  than  a  dozen </p>
<p class="calibre1">punchers and often as many as four hundred, as well as the sorters, tabulators, </p>
<p class="calibre1">verifiers,  multipliers,  and  printing  tabulators  to  process  the  output.  Thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands  of  Change  Forms  from  concentration  camps  across  Europe  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">received  and  processed  each  week  by  the  Hollerith  unit  at  Oranienburg, </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing the SS to efficiently execute its "Extermination by Labor" program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  information  also  surfaced  about  IBM  president  Thomas  J.  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement  in  Germany.  A  former  IBM  employee,  now  in  New  York  State, </p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  a  pamphlet  in  his  basement  and  sent  me  a  copy.  It  was  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">memorative program  of a  luncheon held  in  Watson's  honor just  before  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">received Hitler's medal during the 1937 Berlin International Chamber of Com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">merce  festivities.  The  program  includes  a  picture  of  Watson  surrounded  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">grateful  Hitler  Youth,  and  the  text  of  toasts  by  Nazi  finance  wizard  Hjalmar </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schacht appealing to Watson to help stop the anti-Nazi boycott.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  the  most  astonishing  moment  of  my  postbook  travels  was  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Munich,  after  a  historians'  symposium.  A  long  line  formed  at  my  book-sign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  table.  Two  distinguished-looking  men  finally  presented  their  books  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">autographing.  One  said,  "Make  mine  out  to  Willy  Heidinger,  Jr."  He  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  chairman's  grandson.  He  and  his  cousin  both  congratulated  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">book  for  honestly  retelling  the  story  of  their  grandfather's  involvement  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM.  The  next  morning,  the  Heidingers  and  I  enjoyed  a  long,  delightful </p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast  at  my  hotel.  They  declared  their  view  that  Watson  engineered  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">outright theft of their family's 10 percent of Dehomag, now known as IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Immediately  after  the  war,  they  recalled,  Watson's  representatives </p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied  by  American  army  officials,  drove  out  to  their  home  near </p>
<p class="calibre1">Munich  and  then  pressured  the  family  into  signing  away  their  stock.  Pressur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  Nazi  businessmen  was  not  difficult  in  devastated  and  occupied  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,  the  IBM  shares  the  Heidinger  family  once  controlled  are  worth  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">millions  of  dollars.  The  Heidingers  also  insisted  my  book  conservatively </p>
<p class="calibre1">understated  Watson's  true  sympathies  for  Hitler  and  his  true  knowledge  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the events in Germany.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition,  smoking-gun  information  was  found  upon  re-examining </p>
<p class="calibre1">internal  IBM  correspondence.  On  July  4,  1945,  just  weeks  after  the  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">ended,  the  manager  of  IBM's  Czech  subsidiary,  Dr.  Georg  Schneider,  wrote  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  to  Thomas  J.  Watson  in  New  York,  summarizing  his  loyal  efforts  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">behalf  of  the  New  York  office.  "I  beg  to  give  you  my  report  about  the  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">office  in  Prague,  Czechoslovakia.  . . .   All  the  interests  of  the  IBM  were  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">good  hands.  The  $-rentals  were  transferred  to  the  account  of  IBM  in  Geneva, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  begin  [sic]  of  war  with  U.S.  All  $-rentals  must  be  converted  at  the  rate </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  exchange  of  K25.02  Crowns  =  $1  and  stored  on  the  blocked  account  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM in Prague."17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schneider  added  that  he  met  Watson's  emissary  Harrison  K.  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Berlin,  after  the  U.S.  entered  the  war,  to  obtain  IBM  NY's  permission  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">disguise  German  machines  as  Czech.  "I  made  in  1942,"  Schneider  reminded </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  "with  Mr.  Chauncey,  visiting  Berlin,  an  agreement  and  so  we  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorized  to  buy  machines  from  the  Dehomag  and  to  sell  or  lend  [lease] </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  our  name.  From  each  machine  we  had  to  pay  a  license-tax  [royalty]  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the IBM."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">FRANCE </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Paris,  I  was  contacted  by  Robert  Carmille,  the  son  of  Rene  Cannille.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">met  with  my  French  publisher  and  I.  Robert  Carmille  revealed  an  engaging </p>
<p class="calibre1">story  of  his  father's  long,  patriotic  service  to  France  as  a  counterintelligence </p>
<p class="calibre1">agent  specializing  in  statistics  and  punch  card  technology.  His  father  went  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  twice  before  the  war—in  1935  and  again  in  1938—to  study  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  and  German  war  preparations.  During  these  visits,  the  elder </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  met  with  Dehomag  managers,  and  visited  insurance  companies  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  demonstrations.  While  in  Nazi  Berlin,  he  wrote  home  with  sadness </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  deplorable  conditions  Jews  were  subjected  to  under  the  Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich,  according  to  the  written  record  of  colleagues.  Robert  Carmille </p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled  that  his  father  witnessed  Jews  being  paraded  around  the  city,  wear- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing humiliating signs.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most gripping moment during the hotel suite meeting came when </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert  Carmille,  himself  now  an  elderly  although  still  an  eminently  lucid </p>
<p class="calibre1">man,  emotionally  declared  that  the  French  statistical  service  did  indeed  sabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tage  the  Jewish  tabulations.  We  asked  him  how  he  could  be  so  certain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  trembled  with  tears  in  his  eyes  and  admitted  that  when  he  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-two-years  old  he  had  been  asked  by  his  father  to  manage  the  Lyons </p>
<p class="calibre1">regional  office  and  that  he  had  personally  operated  the  machines  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toulouse.  "We  never  punched  column  eleven!"  Carmille  emotionally  declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never."20 Column eleven contained racial information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Vichy  demographic  service's  main  office  was  at  10  Rue  Archer  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lyons,  but  the  machines  themselves  were  installed  at  Cours  de  Verdun,  near </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  train  station,  recalled  the  younger  Carmille.  Seventeen  regional  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  offices  were  established.  A  typical  installation  might  include  three  tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lators,  five  sorters,  one  calculator,  seven  or  eight  verifiers,  and  twenty  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  punchers.  In  many  offices,  recalls  Carmille,  this  equipment  was  gener- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  70  percent  Bull  and  30  percent  IBM.  However,  Lyons,  Montpellier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toulouse,  and  Claremont-Ferrand  relied  more  heavily  on  Bull,  while  Mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">seilles and some other offices relied more heavily on Hollerith.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  three  weeks  in  1943,  Robert  Carmille  actually  worked  at  the  CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  in  Lyons.  Of  the  several  dozen  CEC  staffers  he  remembers  seeing,  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">least  ten  were  assigned  to  marketing  because  IBM  continually  tried  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase its share of France's Nazi-era punch card business.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  then  displayed  posthumous  commendations  for  valor  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">bravery  bestowed  on  his  father  by  both  the  Allies  and  the  French  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  And  he  showed  us  an  IBM  newsletter  published  during  Nazi  occupa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  for  employees  of  the  French  subsidiary.  The  strictly  business  publication </p>
<p class="calibre1">featured  a  photo  of  an  IBM  commemorative  medal  depicting  Thomas  J.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's face set against a regal laurel wreath.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  a  contemporary  of  the  younger  Carmille's  sent  my  French  pub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lisher  a  CD-ROM  filled  with  photographs  of  heretofore  unknown  docu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments.  They  indicate  that  the  elder  Carmille  was  in  direct  contact  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  of  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen  (MB),  the  Nazi  government  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  agency  in  Berlin.  Lieutenant  von  Passow  of  the  MB  exhorted  the  elder </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille  to  replace  the  French  demographic  service's  Bull  machines  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  equipment,  even  as  Passow  lamented  that  the  German  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  dependent  upon  "American  money  and  technology."  The  documents </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  support  Robert  Carmille's  chronology  that  his  father's  service  took  pains </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  to  extend  the  professional  census  to  the  occupied  zone,  thereby  denying </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Reich information it needed to complete its plan to organize slave labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  France.  This  instruction  was  reversed  once  the  elder  Carmille  was  discov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered and taken to Dachau. But by then, it was too late to materially undo </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carmille's sabotage.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  more  research  has  yet  to  be  undertaken  in  France.    Several </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frenchmen  involved  in  the  statistical  service  have  kept  their  stories  quiet  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">decades  but  are  now  ready  to  offer  the  documents  and  testimony—long  kept </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret—to  chronicle  exacdy  what  was  and  was  not  done  with  punch  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">during the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">POLAND </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  largest  cache  of  discoveries  involved  Poland.  In  1939,  after  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion,  IBM  divided  up  occupied  Poland  into  two  commercial  territories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  centered  in  Upper  Silesia,  in  land  annexed  by  Germany  and  ser- </p>
<p class="calibre1">viced  by  Dehomag.  The  second  was  conducted  in  the  remainder  of  occupied </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland,  the  so-called  General  Government  that  encompassed  cities  such  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krakow  and  Warsaw.  The  General  Government  territory  was  to  be  serviced </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  a  newly  incorporated  IBM  Polish  subsidiary,  known  as  Watson  Buro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">maschinen  GmbH,  directly  controlled  by  IBM  NY.  Polish  survivors  and  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents have shed great light on the Hollerith presence there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historical  journalist  Christian  Habbe  of  Der  Spiegel  first  sent  me  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">formation  regarding  the  Abteilung  Hollerith  at  the  Stutthof  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camp.  The  information  has  been  quietly  residing  on  the  Polish  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">memorial's  recendy  established  Polish-language  website  at  www.kki.net.pl/ </p>
<p class="calibre1">~museum.  Stutthof  was  Hollerith-coded  13.  In  recent  years,  Stutthof </p>
<p class="calibre1">archivist  and  historian  Marek  Orski  has  documented  more  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">about Hollerith than any other camp historian, including those at Auschwitz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stutthof's  Abteilung  Hollerith  was  organized  in  early  August  1944  as  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portations  intensified  and  the  camp's  population  suddenly  grew  to  50,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS  Rottenfuhrer  Werner  Reiss  was  ordered  to  undergo  training  at  a  Zentral </p>
<p class="calibre1">Institut  seminar  at  the  Storkow  concentration  camp,  which  maintained  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">two dozen IBM machines. On August 4, 1944, Reiss took the 6:20 P.M. train to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danzig where he connected to the Berlin express at 11:20 P.M., and then shut- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tled  to  Storkow  The  next  day,  his  training  began.  After  Storkow,  he  attended </p>
<p class="calibre1">additional  seminars  for  "Hollerith  file  experts"  at  the  Zentral  Institut  main </p>
<p class="calibre1">office  at  Block  F,  129  Friedrichstrasse  in  Berlin.  Thereafter,  Reiss  reported  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  SS  Economics  Administration,  Office  D  II  in  Oranienburg,  the  agency </p>
<p class="calibre1">overseeing slave workers and the Extermination by Labor campaign.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Reiss  returned  to  Stutthof,  he  established  the  camp's  Abteilung </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith, assigning a group of Polish prisoners, including Leszek Zdrojewski, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bronislaw  Peplonski,  Julian  Krawczyk,  and  Krzysztof  Dunin-Wasowicz.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">unit  began  working  in  the  canteen  at  Block  XI.  Due  to  the  delay  in  getting </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holleriths,  Stutthof  did  not  yet  have  its  own  machine.  So  the  men  just  manu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  filled  out  the  codable  paper  forms  for  delivery  to  Berlin  and  elsewhere </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  machine  processing.  Eventually  some  80,000  prisoners,  dating  back  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  first  arrests  of  September  1,  1939,  were  entered  into  the  system.  Thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands  of  codable  forms,  locally  referred  to  as  "Hollerith  Kartei"  (even  though </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  were  paper,  not  punch  cards)  are  preserved  in  Stutthof's  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">archival  files.  The  highest  number  belonged  to  Prisoner  99044,  who  entered </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  camp  on  October  27,  1944.  The  punch  cards  identified  nameless  prison- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers  by  their  Hollerith  codes  for  scores  of  needed  job  skills.  Duplicates  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">professional file were maintained in Berlin.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  extraordinary  eyewitness  is  Leszek  Zdrojewski,  who  headed  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stutthof's  Arbeitseinsatz  and  interfaced  with  the  camp's  Abteilung  Hollerith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Fall  1944,  he  was  sent  to  Zentral  Institut  in  Berlin  for  Hollerith  training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accompanied by  Reiss,  Zdrojewski  spent  two  to  three  days at  Zentral  Institut, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  he  saw  some  twenty  sorters  and  tabulators  served  by  a  staff  of  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  100  clerks,  frantically  feeding  machines  and  searching  for  specific  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fessions among the camps' populations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  my  presentation  at  the  Jewish  Historical  Institute  in  Warsaw,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">unexpectedly  encountered  Krzysztof  Dunin-Wasowicz,  one  of  the  prisoners </p>
<p class="calibre1">forced  to  work  in  Stutthof's  Abteilung  Hollerith.  Dunin-Wasowicz  is  now  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">retired  historian,  who  for  some  time  was  associated  with  the  Polish  Academy </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Science  and  understands  the  uses  of  Hollerith.  During  a  twenty-minute </p>
<p class="calibre1">presentation,  he  outlined  the  history  of  IBM's  technology  at  Stutthof.  An </p>
<p class="calibre1">electrifying  moment  came  when  I  held  up  an  enlargement  of  the  secret </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Camp  Codes.  I  pointed  to  code  6,  Sonderbehandlung,  that  is  "exter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mination."  Dunin-Wasowicz  acknowledged  the  codes  were  the  exact  ones  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  used  at  Stutthof,  including  code  6  for  extermination  in  the  camp's </p>
<p class="calibre1">small but active gas chamber, which murdered some one thousand people.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  Polish  eyewitnesses  also  came  forward.  The  newspaper  Slowo  Pol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">skie  located  Leon  Krzemieniecki,  probably  the  only  man  still  living  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  in  the  Hollerith  Department  of  the  railroad  office  that  kept  tabs  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  trains  in  the  General  Government,  including  those  that  sent  Jews  to  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">death  in  Treblinka  and  Auschwitz.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  Krzemieniecki </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  not  understand  any  of  the  details  of  the  genocidal  train  destinations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed  his  duties  required  tabulating  information  on  all  trains,  from  ordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nary  passenger  to  freight  trains.  Krzemieniecki's  interview  in  the  newspaper, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and subsequent extensive oral history with me, revealed that the railway's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith Department in Krakow required a five-room o f f i c e  on Pawia Street </p>
<p class="calibre1">equipped  with  fifteen  punchers,  two  sorters,  and  a  tabulator  that  he  recalls </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  "bigger  than  a  sofa."  The  high-security  office  was  guarded  by  armed  rail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">way police.28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen  Polish  women  were  employed  just  to  punch  the  cards  and  load </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  sorters.  Three  German  nationals  supervised  the  railway  office,  undertak- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  final  tabulations  and  summary  statistics  in  great  secrecy.  Handfuls  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">printouts  were  reduced  to  a  small  envelope  of  summary  data,  which  was  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">delivered  to  a  secret  destination.  Truckloads  of  the  preliminary  printouts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  created  the  secret  summaries,  were  then  regularly  burned,  along  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the spent cards, Krzemieniecki recalls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  forced  laborer,  Krzemieniecki  was  compelled  to  work  as  a  "sorter </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  tabulator"  ten  hours  per  day  for  two  years.  He  never  realized  in  any  way </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  his  work  involved  the  transporation  of  Jews  to  gas  chambers.  "I  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">know  that  this  very  modern  equipment  made  possible  the  control  of  all  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">railway  traffic  in  the  General  Government,"  he  told  the  newspaper.  Only  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM and the Holocaust was released did he begin to recall the significance of </p>
<p class="calibre1">his work.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1944,  as  the  Russians  advanced,  his  group  loaded  the  machines  onto </p>
<p class="calibre1">trucks,  which  moved  the  equipment  to  Dresden.  "I  think  they  vanished  with- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out a trace," he added.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krzemieniecki's  relatively  small  group  punched  in  only  a  limited  amount </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  information  on  the  ten-column  cards,  mainly  the  number  of  the  train, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  it  was  a  cargo  train,  whether  express  or  regular,  and  the  distance </p>
<p class="calibre1">traveled.  For  example,  a  cargo  designation  was  coded  8.  Five-digit  kilometer </p>
<p class="calibre1">records  were  punched  in  as  well.  No  alphabetical  machines  were  used,  hence </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  codes  had  to  be  memorized.  An  "outside  technician,"  who  spoke  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Polish  and  did  not  work  for  the  railroad,  was  almost  constantly  on  site  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  the  machines  running.  The  technician  generally  undertook  major  main- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tenance on the machines approximately once each month.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Pawia  Street  operation  undoubtedly  interfaced  with  a  much  larger </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  robust  Hollerith  operation  at  the  Group  IV  Transportation  Office  else- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  in  Krakow.  This  office  continuously  tabulated  details  about  the  length </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  train  lines,  number  and availability  of locomotives  and  freight  cars, as  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">as the amount and type of cargo, and "the number of persons transported."32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railway  management  was  among  IBM's  most  diverse  and  highly  devel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oped  applications.  Typically,  destinations  were  specifically  preprinted  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  cards  in  order  to  locate  and  route  boxcars  and  engines.  Accounting </p>

<p class="calibre1">printed  at  IBM's  Rymarska  Street  print  shop  across  from  the  Warsaw  Ghetto, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  leased  machines  utilized  by  railways  in  Poland  were  not  under  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  subsidiary,  but  the  New  York-controlled  subsidiary  in  Warsaw,  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son Buromaschinen GmbH. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  knew  they  were  not  German  machines,"  recalled  Krzemieniecki  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  newspaper  interview,  and  in  our  later  discussion.  "The  labels  were  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">English.  .  .  .  The  person  maintaining  and  repairing  the  machines  spread  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">diagrams  out  sometimes.  The  language  of  the  diagrams  of  those  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">was only in English."33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  asked  Krzemieniecki  if  the  machine  logos  were  in  German,  Polish,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">English.  He  answered "English.  It  said  'Business  Machines'"  I  asked,  "Do  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">mean  ' International  Business  Machines'?"  Krzemieniecki  replied,  "No,  'Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  Machines.'"34  That  was  the  correct  answer.  In  Poland,  IBM  NY's </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  subsidiary  operated  under  the  German  legal  name:  Watson  Buromaschi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nen.  But  the  Polish  machines  proudly  bore  logo  tags  with  the  subsidiary's </p>
<p class="calibre1">name in English: Watson Business Machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  most  dramatic  post-book  revelations  was  the  discovery  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  massive  Hollerith  statistical  center  in  Krakow  known  as  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gruppe,  staffed  by  more  than  500  punching  and  tabulating  employees  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">dozens  of  machines.  Research  discovered  a  previously  unknown  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">agency  called  the  Central  Office  for  Foreign  Statistics  and  Foreign  Country </p>
<p class="calibre1">Research,  which  continuously  received  detailed  data  from  the  Statistics </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  of  the  State  Secretariat  in  Krakow.  Nazi  Hollerith  expert  Richard </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muller  headed  the  operation  in  Krakow.35  Discoveries  about  this  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">answered  questions  about  where  much  of  the  data  for  all  of  Poland  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">processed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  variety  of  Hollerith-equipped  Nazi  offices  had  been  operating  across </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied  Poland  from  the  day  of  invasion  on  September  1,  1939.  America </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  in  the  war;  Watson  had  not  yet  returned  his  medal;  and  hence  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained  his  complete  commercial  support  for  the  Hitler  regime  through- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  the  initial  rape  of  Poland.  As  part  of  this  strategic  commercial  support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM NY agreed to a vital installation of machines so massive it was not called </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  Hollerith  Department,  but  a  Hollerith  Gruppe.  This  vital  installation  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">permit  the  Nazis  to  organize  the  systematic  looting  and  subjugation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland, as well as implement other plans for its citizens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just after invasion, Hitler's General Government in Warsaw asked its </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regional  Planning  Department  to  establish  a  Central  Statistics  Office  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">shuttered  Jagiellonian  University  in  Krakow.  By  April  1940,  the  Nazis  formed </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  working  group  comprised  of  a  single  German  statistics  expert  assisted  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">former  employees  of  the  Polish  Statistical  Service  and  other  Polish  civil  ser- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vants.  This  group  sifted  through  some  60,000  printed  volumes  of  raw  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation  in  the  Polish  Statistical  Service  library  in  "Warsaw,  preparatory  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">conversion  to  Hollerith  data.  The  selected  information,  along  with  all  previ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ously  supplied  Hollerith  machines  and  staff,  were  relocated  from  Warsaw  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  Nazi  agency  in  Krakow.  So  large  was  the  enterprise,  the  library  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">raw intelligence to be punched filled two halls.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  September  1940,  the  Reich  issued  a  Decree  for  Statistics  in  Poland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating  the  new  expanded  "Statistics  Office."  Within  a  few  months,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krakow  Statistics  Office  at  24  Nurnerstrasse  subsumed  most  other  statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations in Poland.  By late 1941, the  Statistics  Office  employed  420  persons </p>
<p class="calibre1">including  16  Germans  in  6  distinct  groups—Group  I:  Administration;  Group  II: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Population  and  Culture;  Group  III:  Food  and  Agriculture;  Group  IV:  Eco- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nomic  Trade  and  Transportation;  Group  V:  Social  Statistics;  and  Group  VI: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finance  and  Tax.  A  November  30,  1941,  Statistics  Office  report  explains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  Hollerith  Gruppe  area  of  operation  stretches  across  all  subject  areas," </p>
<p class="calibre1">adding  that  a  major  expansion  plan  would  see  staffing  rise  to  500  persons </p>
<p class="calibre1">within a month.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  expansion  was  dependent  on  more  leased  machines,  spare  parts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  technicians,  and  a  continued,  guaranteed  supply  of  millions  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">additional  IBM  cards.  Because  backlogged  orders  for  Hollerith  machines  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quired  a  year  or  more  to  deliver,  IBM's  long-term  supply  commitment  almost </p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly  dated  to  the  first  days  of  World  War  II.  Indeed,  the  Statistics  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">report  was  written  just  weeks  after  IBM's  European  general  manager  Werner </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier  visited  Berlin  to  oversee  IBM  NY's  deployment  of  machines  in  Poland </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  countries.  The  Krakow  Statistics  Office's  November  30,  1941 </p>
<p class="calibre1">report  assured  Berlin,  "the  installation  of  the  equipment  necessary  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">work  of  the  Hollerith  Gruppe  has  commenced.  It  is  estimated  that  the  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  will  be  ready  for  use  by  the  end  of  the  year,  and  that  training  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prospective  employees  can  begin.  The  employee  designated  as  the  leader  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  group  now  participates  in  a  seminar  in  Berlin  to  train  for  this  subject </p>
<p class="calibre1">area.... Survey material is already in preparation."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Statistics  Office  also  assured  Berlin  that  its  Hollerith  Gruppe  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">employ  equipment  more  modern  than  the  old  IBM  machinery  found  in  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">pre-war  Polish  data  agencies,  thus  allowing  the  Nazi  office  to  launch  a  pleth- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ora of "large-scale censuses." Everything would be counted—and often. Large </p>
<p class="calibre1">scale  "agricultural"  and  "industrial"  censuses  had  already  been  undertaken </p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier  in  1941.  A  new  "residential  census"  was  also  planned.  "But  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  and  complex  census,  t h e   population  and  occupational  census,  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">been in preparation since the beginning of the year," the report specified.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  special  censuses,  the  report  enumerated  a  long  list  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">"continuous  statistical  surveys,"  including  those  for  population  and  culture, </p>
<p class="calibre1">domestic  migration,  infectious  disease,  and  cause  of  death.  Moreover,  regular </p>
<p class="calibre1">food  and  agriculture  surveys  were  "coupled  with  summary  surveys  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">population  and  ethnic  groups."40  Tabulating  food  supplies  against  ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers  allowed  the  Nazis  to  ration  caloric  intake  as  they  subjected  the  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish community to progressive starvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Statistics  Office's  November  30,  1941  report  concludes  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">statement "Our work is just beginning to bear fruit."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  more  information  has  come  to  light  on  IBM  in  other  countries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and will be incorporated into future editions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  a  highly  publicized,  months-long  public  search  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world,  in  which  many  stepped  forward  to  offer  new  materials,  not  a  single </p>
<p class="calibre1">document  was  uncovered  anywhere  in  any  country  indicating  that  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">either  in  New  York  or  Europe,  ever  moderated  its  strategic  alliance  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third  Reich.  Nor  did  IBM,  in  the face  of  continuous  media  requests  after this </p>
<p class="calibre1">hook's  release,  offer  any  documents  or  evidence  to  explain  its  conduct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,  the  company  issued  an  official  statement:  "IBM  does  not  have  much </p>
<p class="calibre1">information about this period," and declined to comment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Publication of the Hardcover Edition of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  AND THE  HOLOCAUST </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON        FEBRUARY        12,        2001,        IBM        AND        THE        HOLOCAUST    </p>
<p class="calibre1">WAS  simultaneously  released  in  nine  languages  and  distributed  in  forty </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nine </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's </p>
<p class="calibre1">most </p>
<p class="calibre1">prestigious </p>
<p class="calibre1">publishers </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  arduously,  time  zone  by  time  zone,  to  ensure  that  the  em- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bargoed  news  broke  worldwide  at  approximately  the  same  hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doing  so  meant  foregoing  the  customary  months  of  advance  cata- </p>
<p class="calibre1">logue  sales  and  store  placement.  But  announcing  the  findings  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rectly  and  responsibly  was  the  number-one  priority.  Our  collective </p>
<p class="calibre1">hope  was  to  make  certain  that  the  explosive  story  did  not  leak  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">sensationalist  or  exaggerated  snippets,  but  was  disclosed  in  a  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plete historical context. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally </p>
<p class="calibre1">important, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I </p>
<p class="calibre1">personally </p>
<p class="calibre1">feared </p>
<p class="calibre1">that </p>
<p class="calibre1">vital </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet  to  be  reviewed  might  be  further  obstructed,  or  might  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  news  finally  broke,  the  result  was  a  profound  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust  revelation  that  shook  countries  and  institutions,  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">scholars  and  other  individuals.  In  many  ways  they  are  still  shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So am I. Here is the story behind that upheaval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  has  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">written </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">book's </p>
<p class="calibre1">secrecy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">book  was  not  made  public  until  February  12,  2001.  But  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  thousand  people  in  numerous  countries  were  involved  in  its  crea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. There was no other way to achieve the level of precision and </p>
<p class="calibre1">review  required  for  such  a  project,  and  to  ensure  the  book's  message  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">not be exaggerated or misconstrued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  began  sharing  information  with  others  two  years  before  publication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  a  hundred  researchers,  historians,  and  volunteers  searched  the  files  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  fifty  archives  and  research  libraries  in  seven  countries.  Throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">actual  writing  in  2000,  some  thirty-five  world-class  Holocaust  historians  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  experts  reviewed  my  work,  chapter  by  chapter,  as  the  text  rolled  off  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">word  processor.  Actually,  I  had  invited  nearly  double  that  number  of  review- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers.  No  scholar  was  off  limits,  but  there  was  a  condition:  Each  reviewer  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  agree  to  read  every  page  in  order,  no  skipping  around.  Hence,  this  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  no  quick  weekend  skim,  but  a  protracted,  line-by-line  effort.  For  example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">noted  historian  Gerhard  Hirschfeld,  president  of  the  International  Commit- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tee  for  the  History  of  the  Second  "World  War,  took  six  months  to  finish  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">methodical  review.  In  this way,  each  scholar  would  absorb the complete story </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  context,  regardless  of  specialty.  We  refused  to  rush  anyone.  Not  all  I  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tacted  had  the  ability  or  inclination to invest  so  much  time.  But  several dozen </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  (see  the  Acknowledgments).  Scores  of  marginal  notations  were  made, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  many  consultations  ensued.  Virtually  all  suggestions  and  corrections </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  adopted.  Then  the  revised  text  was  resubmitted  over  and  over  again </p>
<p class="calibre1">until  approved  by  each  reviewer.  Thus,  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  became  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary  collaborative  effort  of  international  Holocaust  and  technology </p>
<p class="calibre1">expertise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  finished  manuscript  went  to  some  of  the  finest  editors  and  transla- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors  in  the  book  world,  located  on  three  continents,  nearly  all  boasting  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">thick  portfolio  of  Holocaust  publishing  credentials.  The  publishers  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">commenced  their  own  painstaking  reviews,  positing  numerous  questions  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">requests  for  written  clarifications.  Original  French,  German,  or  Dutch  docu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  were  shipped  to  each  foreign  publisher  for  independent  translation </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  verification.  Most  publishers  requested  that  their  own  local  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">specialists read the text as well. Because IBM and the Holocaust was a global </p>
<p class="calibre1">release,  it  was  imperative  that  my  manuscript  be  bulletproof  not  only  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">America,  but  also  in  the  academic  corridors  of  England,  Germany,  France, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland,  Italy,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Poland,  and  the  several  dozen  other  coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries  in  which  it  appeared.  This  imposed  a  welcome  duty  to  harmonize  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">local  experts  on  the  most  subtle  points.  For  example,  Auschwitz  historian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franciszek  Piper,  who  meticulously  read  every  page,  requested  numerous </p>
<p class="calibre1">minute  changes  from  a  strictly  Polish  perspective;  among  them  was  that  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  refer  to  concentration  camps  in  Poland,  but  rather  occupied  Poland.  We </p>
<p class="calibre1">adopted all his corrections in as many editions as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then came the lawyers. My manuscript needed to pass the scrutiny of </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorneys  throughout  the  Americas  and  Europe,  each  applying  the  most  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">servative  standards  prevalent  in  his  country.  In  some  nations,  such  as  Eng- </p>
<p class="calibre1">land,  known  for  its  tough  publishing  laws,  the  test  was  more  than  rigorous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Factual  backup—often  sentence  by  sentence—was  sought  on  point  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">point.  It  was  provided,  and  all  were  satisfied.  In  one  case,  I  carted  sixteen </p>
<p class="calibre1">boxes  of  documentation  into  a  lawyer's  conference  room  for  a  two-day  hair- </p>
<p class="calibre1">splitting  challenge.  I  welcomed  all  such  challenges.  My  files  are  arranged </p>
<p class="calibre1">so  that  any  sentence  in  the  text  can  be  completely  documented  at  the  thirty- </p>
<p class="calibre1">second pull of a folder. Defensive documentation has always been my rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  the  world's  major  media  was  invited  to  launch  its  own  indepen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dent  pre-publication  review.  The  most  respected  networks,  newspapers,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">magazines  in  the  world  assigned  their  most  senior  historical  journalists </p>
<p class="calibre1">known  for  Holocaust  coverage  and  expertise.  For  weeks  before  publication, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  in  some  cases  months,  a  caravan  of  hardened  and  skeptical  print  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">broadcast  journalists  trekked  to  my  basement  outside  Washington,  D.C.,  por- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  over  my  files,  examining  and  filming  documents,  interviewing  experts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  questioning  me.  Concomitantly,  many  launched  their  own  investigations </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Europe,  carefully  scouring  local  archives  and  questioning  experts  to  inde- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pendently verify my information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  long  roster  of  distinguished  media  included  Der  Spiegel  and  Stern </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Germany; the Sunday Times in England; L'Express and Le Monde in France; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newsweek,  The  Washington  Post,  and  Reform  Judaism  in  the  United  States; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Algemeen Dagblad in Holland; and many more. The media group also included </p>
<p class="calibre1">major  TV  networks  in  Germany,  France,  Poland,  Holland,  the  United  States, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  numerous  other  countries.  Each  network  dispatched  its  most  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plished historical journalists with acknowledged Holocaust expertise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Der  Spiegel  independently  discovered  the  Abteilung  Hollerith  in  Stutthof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Algemeen  Dagblad,  in  Amsterdam,  flew  in  its  senior  Auschwitz  expert,  Theo </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gerritse. ZDF-TV in Germany dispatched Ralf Piechowiak, noted for work on </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  respected  Holocaust  documentaries.  NBC  in  America  spent  almost  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">year  before  publication  flying  film  crews  and  researchers  to  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camps,  archives,  and  eyewitnesses  to  meticulously  verify  the  book,  deploying </p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledgeable  producers  who  had  previously  investigated  Chase  Manhattan </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bank's connection to the Third Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  media  was  reviewing  the  manuscript  and  files,  numerous </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  leaders  in  America  and  Europe  were  sent  copies  as  well.  Under  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances  would  I  launch  a  book  of  this  nature  without  briefing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish and Holocaust survivor leadership. Many of these leaders cope with </p>
<p class="calibre1">complex  Holocaust  issues  every  day;  they  are  among  the  best  informed  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  topic,  and  offer  an  indispensable  perspective.  For  example,  David  Saper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stein,  director  of  the  Religious  Action  Center  of  Reform  Judaism,  displayed  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncanny  eye  for  detail  and  contributed  a  number  of  precious  pre-publication </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  February  2001,  hundreds  of  copies  of  the  original  and  revised  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uscripts  were  circulating,  and  as  many  as  a  thousand  people  on  three  conti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nents  had  access  to  the  information.  Archivists  and  scholars  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  were  anxiously  anticipating  the  release.  Scores  of  journalists  and  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">research  staffs  in  a  dozen  countries  were  filming,  inquiring,  and  interviewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  it  all,  the  publishers,  my  agent,  and  I  were  determined  to  release </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  information  in  as  responsible  a  fashion  as  possible.  Each  publisher  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tractually  agreed  to  avoid  any  insensitive  or  sensationalist  marketing,  and  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">extracted  similar  pledges  from  as  many  of  the  other  media  as  possible.  I  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">listed  four  terms  that  my  publishers  were  forbidden  to  use:  exclusive,  secret, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown, and first-time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historical  context,  proper  explanations,  and  a  non-sensationalist  ap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">proach  continued  to  guide  our  every  move.  Jewish  leaders  scheduled  several </p>
<p class="calibre1">historical  presentations  to  answer  community  questions  immediately  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">publication.  The  most  important  one  would  be  held  just  days  after  the  book's </p>
<p class="calibre1">release  at  Temple  Beth  Ami  outside  Washington,  D.C.  It  was  sponsored  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Anti-Defamation  League,  the  Braun  Holocaust  Center,  the  Religious </p>
<p class="calibre1">Action  Center  of  Reform  Judaism,  and  a  consortium  of  other  organizations </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  synagogues.  I  would  speak,  and  openly  show  documents  for  anyone  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">examine.  Academic  presentations  would  also  be  offered  by  two  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's  leading  scholars  on  the  period  and  topic:  Robert  Wolfe,  retired  chief </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  captured  German  documents  for  the  National  Archives  and  arguably  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's  leading  expert  on  Nazi  documentation,  and  William  Seltzer,  the  fore- </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  expert  on  the  use  of  population  statistics  and  Hollerith  technology  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">persecute  minorities  during  the  Holocaust.  Hundreds  of  people  were  invited </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  advance  to  a  Holocaust  presentation  days  before  the  book's  publication, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and none of them knew the specifics. C-SPAN would broadcast the session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  website  was  constructed  at  www.edwinblack.com  to  offer  sample </p>
<p class="calibre1">excerpts  and  other  historian  and  leadership  commentary.  A  single  sedate  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully  worded  press  release  was  readied  by  the  publishers  worldwide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  two  dozen  scholars  and  Jewish  leaders  had  unanimously  written </p>
<p class="calibre1">public letters of endorsement to be released simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  a  point  here.  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  was  not—and  could  not— </p>
<p class="calibre1">be created in isolation. I invited an unprecedented level of pre-publication </p>
<p class="calibre1">review  and  authentication  by  scores  of  independent  sources  all  at  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">unwavering  insistence.  It  was  expensive,  cumbersome,  tedious,  and  fre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quently  a  nerve-wracking,  twenty-four-hours-per-day  undertaking  for  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">publishers;  my  agent,  Lynne  Rabinoff;  my  seasoned,  original  editor  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crown  Publishing,  Douglas  Pepper;  and  myself.  But  in  the  end,  we  could  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">declare  that  we  had  exercised  every  ounce  of  prudence  humanly  possible— </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then some. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Books  had  been  pre-positioned  in  stores  worldwide  in  unlabeled </p>
<p class="calibre1">boxes, with warnings that they could not be opened until February 12, 2001. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  the  leak—it  was  exactly  the  type  of  vague  and  misleading </p>
<p class="calibre1">message  we  were  hoping  to  avoid.  And  it  was  pervasive.  Far  from  an  errant </p>
<p class="calibre1">bookstore,  or  a  reporter jumping  the  gun—the  source  of the  leak  was  where  1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">always expected: IBM itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Days  before  February  12,  IBM  broadcasted  a  global  e-mail  to  its  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  300,000  employees,  warning  that  the  book  would  soon  be  released  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  it  would  evoke  "painful"  topics  about  IBM's  involvement  in  the  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust.  Copies  of  the  e-mail  were  circulated  to  major  news  oudets  around  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world.  That  warning  was  followed  by  a  carefully  crafted  statement:  "IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">does  not  have  much  information  about  this  period  or  the  operations  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag." Then a steady campaign of misinformation began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  always  knew  I  was  working  on  this  book.  In  1999,  after  assem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bling  very  preliminary  research,  I  contacted  IBM's  corporate  archivist  Paul </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lasewicz  for  permission  to  examine  the  company's  archives  in  Somers,  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York.  I  offered  to  share  with  the  company  all  my  findings  so  that  IBM—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world—could  obtain  an  accurate  portrayal  of  the  corporation's  involve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  in  the  Holocaust.  Lasewicz  approved  my  access  but  needed  permission </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  IBM  public  relations  manager  Ian  Colley  to  schedule  the  exact  day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  I  had  spent  weeks  of  waiting,  and  numerous  conversations  with  him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colley  still  refused  to  schedule  my  visit,  claiming  Lasewicz's  archive  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">"understaffed,"  in  massive  disarray  after  years  of  neglect,  and  involved  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">time-consuming Internet project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several  prominent  Holocaust  figures  also  asked  IBM  to  schedule  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">access.  The  importance  of  the  project  was  stressed,  as  were  the  basic  themes </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  identification,  confiscation,  ghettoization,  and  even  concentration  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">extermination.  The  more  we  inquired,  the  quieter  and  more  ambiguous  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  about  its  intentions  to  permit  a  review.  Unbeknownst  to  me,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">used  this  time  to  scour  its  New  York  files.  Nor  did  we  know  that,  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">months  before,  IBM  had  hired  a  group  of  litigation  historians  who  search </p>
<p class="calibre1">government archives worldwide for incriminating corporate links to Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  to  tackle  the  company's  own  8,400  cubic  feet  of  files.  We  knew  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  a  history,  going  back  to  the  Hitler  era,  of  moving  files  from  obscure </p>
<p class="calibre1">place  to  obscure  place,  losing  critical  documents,  purging  records,  and  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying files. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  several  months,  I  wrote  a  blunt  letter  to  IBM  chairman  Louis  Gerst- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner,  openly  sending  copies  to  numerous  senior  executives:  "I  and  others  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">repeatedly  asked  since  May  of  1999  that  I  be  allowed  into  the  IBM  Archives </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  New  York  to  conduct  my  research  regarding  IBM's  role  in  Nazi  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  in  the  Holocaust.  Your  company  has  consistently  refused  to  allow  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">access,  indicating  the  topic  of  the  Holocaust  is  'not  a  priority'  for  IBM.  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  again  repeat  my  request  that  IBM  stop  stonewalling  on  this  issue  and  open </p>
<p class="calibre1">your  archive.  I  also  ask  that  until  that  moment  comes,  you  order  a  halt  to any </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  all  purges  and/or  destruction  of  Holocaust-era  documents.  I  am  writing </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  letter  so  there  will  be  no  question  as  to  the  stonewalling  conduct  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">being displayed by  IBM." I  wrote several more letters like that to Gerstner, as </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  esteemed  Holocaust  historians  and  archivists  Sybil  Milton  and  Robert </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wolfe, as well as Jewish media editors who were aware of my work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  stalling  for  months  in  the  face  of  continued  pressure,  IBM  suddenly </p>
<p class="calibre1">took  action  by  transferring  about  a  thousand  pages  of  their  Somers,  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  documents  to  an  academic  institution.  The  documents  were  "loaned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  IBM  did  not  "lend"  this  material  to  any  recognized  Holocaust  or  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">archive,  such  as  the  Holocaust  Museum  in  Washington,  D.C.,  or  even  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Center  for  Jewish  History  in  Manhattan.  Instead,  an  IBM  public  relations </p>
<p class="calibre1">manager  called  the  public  relations  director  at  New  York  University,  seeking </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  transfer  the  documents  to  NYU's  Department  of  Hebrew  and  Judaic  Stud- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ies,  famous  for  Biblical-era  scholarship.  Six  boxes  were  abrupdy  shipped  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  departmental  chairman  Lawrence  Schiffman,  an  esteemed  Dead  Sea </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrolls  scholar.  Schiffman,  with  no  idea  what  was  in  the  boxes,  innocently </p>
<p class="calibre1">stored  them  in  his  office  closet.  For  IBM's  part,  the  company  could  tell  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">media  it  had  donated  the  files  to  a  scholar—even  though  the  scholar's  exper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tise was in the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  an  IBM  employee  group  in  Germany  had  separately </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreed  to  allow  me  access  to  their  files  outside  Stuttgart.  Several  years </p>
<p class="calibre1">before,  IBM  Germany  had  arranged  for  its  Nazi-era  files  to  be  shunted  to  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">obscure,  abandoned  IBM  warehouse  located  a  forty-five-minute  train  ride </p>
<p class="calibre1">away  from  Stuttgart.  A  group  of  former  German  employees  in  the  "IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klub"  stored  the  files  in  a  private  Hollerith  museum  called  the  House  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Data.  I  flew  to  Stuttgart  in  September  1999  for  my  scheduled  visit.  But  Col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ley learned of the visit and at the last minute instructed the Klub's amateur </p>
<p class="calibre1">historian to deny me access. On  a gray, rainy afternoon, I stood in front of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the museum door at the appointed hour,  hoping to  be let  in.  But   the </p>
<p class="calibre1">museum  was  instructed  to  shut  down  that  day.  Talking  only  into  a  door </p>
<p class="calibre1">intercom,  I  repeatedly  asked,  "What  are  you  hiding?"  A  voice  responded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You must call Ian Colley." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,  Colley  warned  me,  "You  won't  get  access  to  any  IBM  facility  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world,  no  IBM  archive,  no  IBM  library."  He  also  told  me  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">was getting ready to move the Stuttgart documents to another location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  continued  to  receive  letters  of  protest.  In  mid-September  and  early </p>
<p class="calibre1">October  1999,  Gerstner  and  numerous  senior  managers  at  IBM  received  sev- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eral  of  these.  Sybil  Milton  wrote  Gerstner,  "As  former  senior  historian  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  Holocaust  Memorial  Museum,  I  am  aware  of  the  importance  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">researching  the  subject  of  IBM's  involvement  with  Nazi  Germany,  including </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  not  limited  to  its  Hollerith  machines.  . . .   I  understand  that  documents </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  withdrawn  before  Mr.  Black  arrived  in  Stuttgart  and  [others  were] </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  to  the  NYU  Department  of  Hebrew  and  Judaic  Studies.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">appears  to  be  an  act  of  obstruction  intended  to  impede  access  and  research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[The]  NYU  [department]  specializes  in  Biblical  archaeology  and  pre-twenti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eth  century  learning  and  is  inappropriate  as  an  archival  repository  for  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">materials;  indeed  the  physical  transfer  and  potential  disarray  of  these  records </p>
<p class="calibre1">seems  likely  to  obstruct  further  access  and  research.  I  have  known  Mr.  Black </p>
<p class="calibre1">since  the  early  1980s.  His  previous  studies  have  focused  on  Holocaust-era </p>
<p class="calibre1">finances  and  Jewish  affairs  and  speak  for  themselves.  He  is  a  responsible </p>
<p class="calibre1">researcher  familiar  with  the  subject.  He  is  thorough  and  fair  in  his  analysis </p>
<p class="calibre1">and writing." She demanded IBM open its archives to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert  Wolfe  wrote,  "Until  1995,  I  served  with  the  National  Archives </p>
<p class="calibre1">for more than a third of a century of service as its specialist for captured Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich,  war  crimes  trial  and  World  War  II  records.  .  .  .  Black's  latest  project </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeks  information  about  IBM's  involvement  in  statistical  work  performed  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich.  ...  As  an  archivist  of  decades  of  experience,  I  am  taken </p>
<p class="calibre1">aback at such a cavalier denial of access to a project of such potential historic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">humanitarian  and  moral  significance.  As  an  archivist  and  historian,  I  can  as- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  you  there  is  no  justification—commercial,  historical  or  archival—for </p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding  this  material  or  obstructing  efforts  to  access  it....  The  sudden  transfer </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  selected  files  to  the  NYU  Department  of  Judaic  Studies,  a  university  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">partment  known  primarily  for  Biblical  and  Medieval  studies  with  little  archival </p>
<p class="calibre1">capability  and  devoid  of  any  transmittal  papers  allowing  NYU  to  show  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents,  rather  than  working  with  a  recognized  Holocaust-oriented  institu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion, suggests obstructive timing to thwart Black's research. This is a familiar </p>
<p class="calibre1">tactic  for  keeping  document  on  the  move  and  hamstringing  them  in  archival </p>
<p class="calibre1">processing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several  major  Jewish  leaders  then  contacted  Professor  Schiffman,  indi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cating  that  the  documents  in  his  closet  were  of  great  significance  to  the  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  community,  and  urging  him  to  share  them  with  me.  Quickly,  Schiffman </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  the  hero  of  the  documents.  He  immediately  secured  legal  permission </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  university  attorneys  to  show  them  to  me.  I  was  given  complete </p>
<p class="calibre1">access.  The  selection  of  the  seemingly  boring,  completely  unprocessed  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porate  documents  IBM  had  loaned  NYU  was  quite  sparse.  Virtually  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">wartime  documents  were  conspicuously  missing.  But  by  adding  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  other  archives,  I  was  able  to  assemble  the  story.  Indeed,  Schiffman </p>
<p class="calibre1">received  an  advance  copy  of  my  manuscript  and  joined  other  scholars  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">endorsing  the  book.  Schiffman  declared,  "Edwin  Black's  IBM  and  the  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust  is  a  thoroughly  researched,  meticulously  documented  history  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">relationship  of  a  corporate  giant  and  the  advanced  technology  it  sold  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Reich, its war effort, and its plan to exterminate the Jews." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  the  months,  I  had  phoned  IBM  officials  dozens  of  times,  seeking </p>
<p class="calibre1">access  to  documents  and  explanations  of  their  Hitler-era  actions.  I  outlined </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  information  discovered  in  my  research  with  specificity  so  that  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  understood  the  gravity  of  the  implications.  Each  time,  Colley  stayed  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">message,  declaring  IBM  would  not  discuss  the  period  or  my  findings.  Nor </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  I  have  access.  At  one  frustrated  and  emotional  point,  I  asked  if  Colley </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  search  the  archives  for  a  copy  of  my  mother's  punch  card.  He  coolly </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied,  "I'm  not  going  to  get  drawn  into  that  question."  After  about  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred such calls, I simply gave up. IBM would never cooperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things  were  quiet  at  IBM  throughout  the  beginning  of  2000.  But  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">May 2000, IBM was again reminded that my research was progressing rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  eminent  professor  who  had  been  helpful  and  was  aware  of  my  work  let </p>
<p class="calibre1">slip  a  comment  to  reporters  in  Jerusalem  that  a  book  would  soon  be  released </p>
<p class="calibre1">proving  that  "IBM  helped  Hitler  exterminate  the  Jews."  Israeli,  German,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austrian  reporters  aggressively  called  Ian  Colley,  who  had  by  now  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred  to  Paris,  asking  what  IBM's  role  was  during  the  Holocaust.  Colley </p>
<p class="calibre1">answered  by  saying  the  company  "knew  little  about  the  German  subsidiary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  a  few  days,  the  isolated  radio  and  newspaper  reports  ceased.  Sometime </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  that  leak,  IBM  arranged  to  transfer  several  linear  meters  of  its  Stuttgart </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents  to  business  archives  at  Hohenheim  University  in  Germany,  where </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  are  being  "inventoried"  and,  as  of  this  writing,  are  still  inaccessible.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents arrived at Hohenheim just weeks before my book was released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also in the weeks before publication, reporters began contacting IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  relations  manager  Carol  Makovich  and  other  IBMers,  seeking  official </p>
<p class="calibre1">responses  to  the  specific  findings  in  the  book.  IBM  stuck  to  its  story  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Information  Company"  had  no  information  about  the  documents  in  its  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">archives,  and  had  transferred  some  documents  to  esteemed  institutions  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  known  for  two  years  that  my  book  was  coming.  During  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  years,  I  and  others  had  been  asking  for  access  and  answers,  and  during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  seven  years  their  logo-emblazoned  machine  had  been  prominendy  dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">played  at  the  Holocaust  Museum  in  Washington,  D.C.,  prompting  enormous </p>
<p class="calibre1">speculation,  IBM  claimed  it  had  never  tried  to  look  into  its  own  records  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">document its own past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  press  inquiries  made  it  clear  that  the  book  was  just  days  away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  pre-empted  with  its  own  global  press  release—essentially,  the  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">official  statement  it  has  issued.  IBM's  statement  reiterated  that  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  no  information  about  the  period  or  its  own  documents.  The  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">added  the  first  of  a  series  of  well-parsed  phrases,  and  what  can  only  be  seen </p>
<p class="calibre1">as conscious  misinformation.  For example,  IBM's  statement  declares, "As  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds  of  foreign-owned  companies  that  did  business  in  Germany  at  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">time,  Dehomag  came  under  the  control  of  Nazi  authorities  prior  to  and  dur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing World War II." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  clearly,  the  public  facts  are  otherwise.  Watson  received  his  medal </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  Hitler  in  1937.  The  war  began  on  September  1,  1939.  IBM  exercised </p>
<p class="calibre1">highly  visible  minute-to-minute  on-site  micro-management  of  its  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary—and  indeed  all  its  European  subsidiaries—until  the  summer  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940  when  Watson  was  pressured  into  returning  the  medal.  Until  the  late  fall </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  1941,  IBM  NY  ruled  the  German  unit  through  stalwart  European  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agers  who  were  backed  up  by  German  and  American  attorneys.  IBM's  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  was  released  even  as  the  Sunday  Times  (London)  posted  to  its  website </p>
<p class="calibre1">incriminating  October  1941  IBM  internal  correspondence  with  Watson  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">firming  the  fashion  in  which  IBM  NY  controlled  its  German,  Polish,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian operations two years after the war began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  after  the  U.S.  entered  the  war  in  December  1941,  IBM  never  lost </p>
<p class="calibre1">control  of  its  companies  in  Nazi-controlled  lands.  When  German  custodians, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  receivers,  took  over,  virtually  all  IBM  staff  and  management  remained  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">place.  Only  the  profits  were  temporarily  blocked  as  in  any  receivership.  After </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  war,  IBM  fought  to  recover  all  those  Nazi-blocked  bank  accounts,  claim- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing they were legitimate company profits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through </p>
<p class="calibre1">spokeswoman </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makovich, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remains </p>
<p class="calibre1">consciously </p>
<p class="calibre1">silent </p>
<p class="calibre1">about the numerous other European subsidiaries controlled during the </p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve-year Holocaust directly from New York or through its Geneva office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  include  subsidiaries  in  Switzerland,  France,  Spain,  Poland,  Romania, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  dozens  of  other  territories.  Nor  will  Makovich  make  any  mention  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler-era  documents  still  held  by  IBM  subsidiaries  in  Poland,  Argentina, </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  Italy,  Holland,  and  many  other  countries.  The  corporation  has  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  repeatedly,  but  simply  declines  to  respond  and  refers  callers  to  its  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  only  on-the-record  statement.  Indeed,  as  recently  as  September  2001, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  told  an  American  Jewish  Congress  regional  board  member  in  Dallas </p>
<p class="calibre1">that the company had no information on the topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  details  of  IBM's  obstruction  were  not  included  in  the  original </p>
<p class="calibre1">book's  introduction.  In  my  view,  that  would  have  been  a  distraction  that  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  welcomed.  The  paramount  issue  is  not  IBM's  obstruction  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-first  century,  but  its  involvement  with  the  Hitler  regime  from  1933  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">1945.  My  personal  struggle  to  obtain  this  information  is,  in  my  view,  but  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">tertiary footnote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  public,  it  seems,  has  not  accepted  IBM's  vague  and  parsed  words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  book  became  an  immediate  New  York  Times  bestseller  in  America,  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">similar  results  across  Europe  and  Latin  America.  In  many  countries,  such  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Canada,  Ireland,  and  Brazil,  the  book  achieved  the  number-one  slot.  This  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">meaningful  not  as  a  measure  of  commercial  success,  but  only  as  a  gauge  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world's  acceptance  of  the  information.  Average  people,  most  of  whom </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  no  detailed  understanding  of  the  Holocaust  or  its  twelve-year  chronol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ogy,  are  now  avidly  reading  the  unhappy  details.  Word  of  mouth  is  stronger </p>
<p class="calibre1">than any minute on TV or inch of type. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  day  I  continue  to  receive  emotional  emails  and  letters  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians,  Jews,  and  others  from  all  over  the  world,  giving  thanks  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  in  the  book  and  deploring  IBM's  past  involvement  and  its  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinued  silence.  One  gentleman  wrote,  "For  days  now,  I  have  not  slept  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">since  reading  your  book.  This  is  my  fourth  reading.  I  am  haunted  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">image of IBM working with the Nazis to schedule trains to gas chambers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  a  few  are  from  thankful  current  or  former  IBM  employees  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">admit  that  rumors  circulated  around  the  company  for  years.  The  descendant </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  one  key  IBM  official  mentioned  in  the  book  remembered  innocendy  play- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  with  Nazi  punch  cards  as  a  child,  and  wrote, "Your  book  will  never  leave </p>
<p class="calibre1">me.  So  many  hands  stained,  I  am  sorry  that  my  family  name  played  a  major </p>
<p class="calibre1">role  in  what  is  history's  greatest  wrong—perished  innocent  people...  Thank </p>
<p class="calibre1">you for taking the painstaking efforts to uncover both of our families' history." </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  my  speaking  events,  the  audiences  are  angry  and  emotional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These people demand answers from IBM. But answers have yet to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worse, in place of answers, IBM's Makovich offers tortured tautologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  the  told  the  C-Net  Internet  news  service:  "As  far  as  we  know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nature  of  the  contacts  between  IBM  executives  and  German  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  during  the  1930s  were  similar  to  those  with  other  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  in  other  countries  and  consistent  with  IBM  practices  in  the  various </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries in which the company did business during that era." </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  that,  Makovich  has  quietly  plied  the  media  with  a  twelve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">page  background  fax  or  email  of  distraction,  misinformation,  unverified </p>
<p class="calibre1">information,  and  negative  reviews.  As  reviewers  and  reporters  on  tight  dead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lines  digest  the  conflicting  information,  and  weave  it  into  their  work,  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">method  has  cultivated  some  confusion.  It  seems  that  the  most  important </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  for  IBM  is  not  clarity,  but  confusion  about  its  activities.  The  more  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fusion  IBM  engenders,  the  more  ambiguous  its  role  might  become.  Fortu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nately,  that  has  generally  not  been  the  case.  Some  400  public  reviews  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">commentaries  by  respected  historians  and  reviewers  have  lauded  the  book, </p>
<p class="calibre1">despite  the  misinformation  in  IBM's  campaign.  Scores  of  these  public </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviews have been posted to my website, www.edwinblack.com. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  is  true  that  a  small  number  of  historians—about  a  dozen—have </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  unduly  defensive.  We  fully  anticipated  that  some  historians  would  react </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  way.  After  all,  15  million  people  had  seen  the  machine  at  the  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">Museum  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and  no  one  had  yet  connected  the  dots.  Few </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  tried.  In  my  introduction,  I  clearly  wrote,  "Historians  should  not  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">defensive  about  the  absence  of  even  a  mention  [about  IBM's  role  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust]."  I  always  understood  that  the  task  required  a  special  combina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  Holocaust  knowledge  with  an  emphasis  on  Hitler-era  finance,  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  information-technology  expertise,  sifted  through  the  dogged  techniques </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  an  investigative  reporter.  Instead  of  using  the  book's  revelations  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">springboard  for  additional  research,  several  esteemed  but  embarrassed  his- </p>
<p class="calibre1">torians sought to defensively find excuses to deny its findings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  Holocaust  denial,  Hollerith  denial  requires  meticulous  documenta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  to  refute.  But  in  both  cases,  the  sad  facts  of  Hitler's  solutions  are  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">escapable.  For  example,  one  elderly,  eminent,  but  highly  defensive  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">historian  who  had  not  read  the  full  book  opined  in  a  Frankfurter  Rundschau </p>
<p class="calibre1">interview  that  Hollerith  machines  were  mainly  used  for  census  during  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  years,  and  the  ghettos  and  Jewish  organizations  had  no  such  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines.  In  his  many  respected  books,  this  historian  had  never  mentioned  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">topic,  and  indeed  the  gentleman  had  no  grasp  on  the  technology.  The  news- </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper  subsequently  published  my  corrections  that  the  main  use  was  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">census—which occurred only once every five or ten years in any country, but </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  customized  financial,  statistical,  railroad,  and  inventory  management  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">clicked  ceaselessly  hour  to  hour  throughout  Europe  during  the  Hitler  era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  published  Frankfurter  Rundschau,  the  technology  did  not  require </p>
<p class="calibre1">on-site  machines.  For  example,  some  41  million  census  forms  from  across </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  were  trucked  into  one  central  office  at  Alexanderplatz  in  Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  concentration  camps  operated  Hollerith  Departments  with  no  machines; </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  simply  messenged  their  punch  cards  or  coded  paper  forms  to  Berlin  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oranienburg for processing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  prominent  American  business  magazine  published  an  ad  hominem </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  vitriolic  review  by  a  Reich-era  business  historian  who  tried  his  best  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">defend  IBM.  The  review  asserted,  "When  data  processors  finally  appeared  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  forced  labor  camps  ...  they  had  little  effect  on  the  fates  of  the  inmates." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  hard  to  envision  a  program  named  Extermination  by  Labor  that  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">"little  effect  on  the  fates  of  the  inmates."  The  misinformed  reviewer  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">clamored  that  the  SS  Race  and  Settlement  Office  did  not  even  receive  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  until  1943,  as  though  this  marginal  agency  was  somehow  vital  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  extermination  effort.  Few  know  that  the  obscure  SS  Race  and  Setdement </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  was  a  screening  service  for  adoptions  and  marriages  by  SS  officers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which is why it did not receive a machine until 1943, a point my book  makes </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  two  separate  chapters.  The  Race  and  Setdement  Office  is  so  marginal,  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">work  is  unmentioned  in  virtually  every  standard  Holocaust  reference.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewer  even  tried  to  excuse  Watson's  collaboration,  writing,  "Unless  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  was  prepared  to  write  off  his  assets  in  Germany  ...  he  had  litde  choice </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  to  put  the  best  face  on  happenings  there,  or  to  bite  his  tongue,  and  culti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vate good relations with German leaders." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  review  in  that  business  magazine  was  immediately  condemned  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Anti-Defamation League as "morally bankrupt," and they added that it "not </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  distorts  the  historical  facts  of  the  period,  but  virtually  argues  in  favor  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  collaboration  with  the  Nazis.  .  .  .  Millions  of  dispossessed  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">exterminated  Jews,  had  they  known,  would  have  hoped  a  major  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation  would  have  foregone  the  pursuit  of  these  profits."  The  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">magazine prompdy published my rebuttal, linked it and my own website to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">archival  article  on  its  website,  and  then  ran  a  second  laudatory  review,  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">claring, "With exhaustive research, Black makes the case that IBM and Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">conspired  with  Nazi  Germany  to  help  automate  the  genocide  of  Europe's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews."  The  turnabout  was  obvious,  but  that  did  not  stop  IBM  from  continu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  distributing  the  first  condemned  review—and  not  the  second—to  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewers and inquiring historians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defensive and misinformed conclusions and analysis are one thing, but </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  astonished  when  a  few  eminent  historians  published  -  or  tried  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">publish  highly  detailed  information  out  of  thin  air  without  a  single  docu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  to  justify  it.  For  example,  one  esteemed  reviewer  in  a  major  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">daily  wrote  with  great  authority  that  machines  at  Dachau  were  only  used  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">payroll,  or  that  they  were  installed  at  Buchenwald  in  August  1944  but  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">destroyed  weeks  later.  I  launched  an  international  effort  to  locate  even  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">document  to  support  these  groundless  statements.  The  result  was  new  discov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eries  (see  the  Afterword),  which  only  deepened  the  original  book's  findings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wary of publishing false Holocaust information devoid of any basis in fact, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">managing  editor  of  the  New  York  daily  asked  the  book  review  editor  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewer  to  provide  documents  to  support  the  statements.  "When  no  primary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">secondary,  or  even  tertiary  documentation  was  forthcoming,  the  newspaper </p>
<p class="calibre1">published  my  letter  stating  that  the  review  "relies  on  many  startling  misstate- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  of  known  historical  documentation.  Several  researchers  have  checked </p>
<p class="calibre1">records  in  Germany  and  America,  attempting  to  verify  .  .  .  [the  reviewer's] </p>
<p class="calibre1">claims  about  Hollerith  machines.  We  have  been  unable  to  locate  a  single  his- </p>
<p class="calibre1">torian,  survivor,  archivist,  or  editor  anywhere  who  can  produce  even  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-era document, oral testimony, or memoir to support" the assertions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,  other  editors  learned  that  eminent  credentials  were  no  guarantee </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  a  factual  review  of  IBM's  role  in  the  Holocaust.  One  of  the  most  reliable </p>
<p class="calibre1">magazines  of  Israeli  and  Jewish  affairs  ran  a  review  by  a  highly  respected </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust  author,  again  filled  with  ad  hominem  references.  This  review  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">filled  with  numerous  errors  and  distortions,  and  concluded  with  this  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment:  "This  strange  type  of  pre-publication  'peer  review,'  in  which  the  read- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers  are  chosen  by  Black,  raises  more  than  a  few  questions  about  the  book's </p>
<p class="calibre1">reliability.  Having  spoken  to  several  of  them  after  they  had  read  the  book, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  found  that  they  all  overlapped  on  one  point:  that  Black  took  an  interesting </p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  and  built  it  up  beyond  proportion,  probably  in  order  to  tell  a  better </p>
<p class="calibre1">story."  The  reviewer's  many  false  statements  and  errors  were  detailed  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">magazine's  editor.  Upon  questioning,  the  historian  confirmed  to  the  aston- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ished  magazine  editor  that  none  of  my  pre-publication  reviewers  were  actu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally  contacted.  The  review  was  immediately  pulled  from  the  magazine's </p>
<p class="calibre1">website.  My  letter  of  correction  was  published  shortly  thereafter  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">publication sent me an official letter of thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  best-read  history  journal  in  England  abruptly  cancelled  a  review </p>
<p class="calibre1">submitted  by  one  of  Britain's  most  distinguished  Holocaust  historians.  That </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewer  had  asserted  this  bizarre  technologic  statement:  "The  Hollerith  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were inflexible, obviously subject to frequent human error, easily torn, and had </p>
<p class="calibre1">to be programmed on a time-consuming one-by-one basis. It is not surprising </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  Nazis  did  not  use  them  on  a  regular  basis  in  carrying  out  the  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust." Punch cards were printed by the millions, not programmed one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  this  writing,  a  prestigious  Ivy  League  history  journal  has  promised </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  intensely  scrutinize  before  publishing  a  review  by  an  eminent  historian  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  business  until  numerous  complaints  of  errors  can  be  resolved.  Those </p>
<p class="calibre1">complaints  came  to  light  when  the  challenged  review  was  faxed  to  a  histor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ical  institute  just  before  my  speaking  engagement  there—months  before </p>
<p class="calibre1">scheduled publication. A historian in New England is working on a joint letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  me  retracting  and  correcting  his  mistaken  review  in  a  scholarly  journal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  he  admits  unfortunately  relied  upon  the  business  weekly's  review  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">demned  by  the  ADL  as  a  "distortion  of  history"  and  "morally  bankrupt."  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  England  reviewer,  like  several  others,  blindly  repeated  statements  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  SS  Race  and  Setdement  Office,  not  knowing  what  the  agency  was.  Many </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  publications  have  recanted,  corrected,  or  cancelled  error-filled  reviews </p>
<p class="calibre1">that engage in Hollerith denial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  I  was  astonished  by  the  statements  of  a  few  historians,  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">friends  in  academia  simply  chuckled.  They  had  seen  it  many  times  before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,  others  involved  in  the  study  of  Holocaust  history  did  not  find  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">misstatements  humorous.  "Most  dismaying  to  me  was  the  reaction  of  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Holocaust  scholars  I  had  come  especially  to  respect,"  says  "Wolfe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">arguably  one  of  the  world's  most  accomplished  Holocaust  scholars.  He  adds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some  refused  to  read  the  book,  others  indulged  in  ad  hominem  attacks  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  author.  They  are  defensive  because  they  were  scooped.  ...  I  have  always </p>
<p class="calibre1">assumed  that  the  essence  of  scholarship  is  .  .  .  cogent  interpretation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">best  available  sources.  Perhaps  it  is  embarrassing  that  most  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">experts  (with  the  notable  exception  of  the  late  Sybil  Milton)  missed  the  role </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  punch-cards  in  enabling  the  Third  Reich  . . .   to  engage  in  war  crimes  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  operating  concentration  camps  where  extermination  through  labor  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">conducted.  Some  of  the  most  telling  records  of  the  amoral  and  profitable </p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement  of  IBM  with  Nazi  Germany  were  in  my  custody  for  a  third  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">century, but it took Edwin Black to draw their significance to my attention." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  while  readying  my  Afterword,  I  issued  a  worldwide  call  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  corrections  of  "fact  or  fact  context"  that  could  be  incorporated  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  edition.  I  asked  for  any  documentation  to  be  attached.  The  notice  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">repeatedly  posted  at  the  most  visible  Holocaust  sites  on  the  Internet,  circu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lated  to  several  dozen  university  history  departments,  and  I  even  personally </p>
<p class="calibre1">phoned  likely  critics  soliciting  corrections.  None  came.  That  said,  one  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">publication  reader  did  remind  me  to  correct  a  few  minor  errors  discovered </p>
<p class="calibre1">just before publication of the hardcover involving the number and type of </p>
<p class="calibre1">questions  on  nineteenth-century  American  consus  forms.  We  also  corrected </p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous  typos.  Other  than  that,  the  main  chapters  of  the  paperback  are  vir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tually identical to those of the hardcover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,  the  few  isolated  instances  of  Hollerith  denial  were  margin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">alized  by  most  reputable  historians  and  the  public.  People  continued  to  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mand  accountability.  Numerous  lawsuits  were  filed  or  threatened  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  by  Jews  in  America,  Poland,  and  France,  and  by  Gypsies  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe,  seeking  to  open  IBM's  archives.  Ironically,  some  of  these  lawsuits </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  deemed  to  threaten  the  final  financial  reparations  agreed  to  by  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  Eventually,  rather  than  endure  months  and  years  of  additional  delay </p>
<p class="calibre1">due  to  any  IBM  litigation,  U.S.  and  German  government  officials  as  well  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">organizational  leaders  pressured  the  plaintiffs'  lawyers  to  desist.  The  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Department  itself  issued  a  statement  announcing  one  lawsuit  dismissal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">asserting,  "The  primary  remedy  sought  by  the  plaintiffs  in  the  IBM  case  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  opening  of  IBM's  archives  in  relation  to  the  World  War  II  period.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  strongly  supports  the  opening  of  all  archives,  public  and  pri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vate,  relating  to  the  Holocaust  era  in  order  to  facilitate  further  research  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">encourage  greater  understanding  of  the  Holocaust  and  its  historical  context." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  other  than  the  two  partial  transfers,  none  of  the  other  archives </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  yet  been  opened.  Nor  did  the  carefully  worded  State  Department  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment indicate when those IBM archives might be opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  date,  IBM  has  never  acknowledged  or  explained  its  twelve-year </p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement  with  the  Hitler  regime.  Nor  has  it  apologized  for  its  role  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust  or  the  German  war  machine.  Nor  has  it  opened  its  numerous </p>
<p class="calibre1">archives.  I  firmly  believe  that  the  people  of  IBM  today  are  good  people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  of  them  are  friends.  But  IBM  has  received  terrible  advice  from  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  relations  people.  IBM  should  take  a  lesson  from  its  Nazi  customers— </p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledge  and  reveal  its  activities  and  move  on.  Instead,  it  seems,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM is hoping the matter will simply go away. </p>
