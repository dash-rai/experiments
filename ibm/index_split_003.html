<p class="calibre1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p>
<p class="calibre1">RARELY  DOES  A  BOOK  OF  HISTORY  INVOLVE  SO  MANY  DOZENS </p>
<p class="calibre1">OF PEOPLE who were so important. But this one does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  this  investigation  involved  documents  in  so  many  countries </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  in  so  many  languages,  I  relied  on  a  network  of  researchers  and  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lators,  many  of  them  volunteers.  The  team  consisted  of  Holocaust  survi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vors,  children  of  survivors,  retirees,  and  students  with  no  connection  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust—as  well  as  professional  researchers,  distinguished  archivists  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">historians, and even former Nuremberg Trial investigators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  more  than  100  people  in  seven  countries  participated,  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  months  at  a  time,  many  for  a  few  weeks  between  jobs  or  during  school </p>
<p class="calibre1">breaks,  and  some  for  just  a  few  hours  when  we  needed  specific  documents </p>
<p class="calibre1">translated.  For  most,  their  mission  was  simply  to  scour  record  groups  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspaper  microfilm  looking  for  certain  key  words  or  topics,  knowing  little </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  implications  of  what  they  were  finding.  Once  documents  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">located,  they  were  copied  and  sent  to  me  for  review  and  analysis.  When  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered  a  lead,  we  would  ask  for  follow-up  research  on  a  targeted  theme </p>
<p class="calibre1">or name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Researchers  and  translators  were  recruited  through  Internet  sites,  uni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">versity  bulletin  boards,  Holocaust  survivor  organizations,  archivists,  histori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ans,  translator-researcher  associations,  and  friends  of  friends  of  friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invariably,  researchers  were  sorry  to  leave  the  project  because  of  other  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mitments,  and  so  they  generally  replaced  themselves  with  trusted  friends </p>
<p class="calibre1">who could carry on their work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously, space does not permit me to list all those who helped in so </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  ways.  But  I  would  like  to  highlight  a  lew.  Gaylon  Finklea  and  Mary  Jo </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osgood  in  Austin,  Texas,  organized  a  team  of  volunteers  to  screen  the  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  Times  from  1933  to  1945.  They  worked  lunch  periods,  evenings,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">weekends  in  front  of  microfilm  readers  to  create  a  unique  newspaper  history </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  evolving  business  and  persecution  aspects  of  the  Holocaust-era.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Texas  group  was  joined  by  about  a  dozen  researchers  in  several  other  cities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  1,500  hours  of reviewing  was required. Terra  York  in  Washington, </p>
<p class="calibre1">D.C.,  monitored  the  team's  progress,  and  like  a  traffic  manager  broadcast  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">continuously changing microfilm reading assignments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  personally  labored  in  the  archives  of  England,  Israel,  Germany,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">America.  But  I  was  indispensably  assisted  in  Britain  by  Jane  Booth,  Andy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farenden,  Matt  Martinson,  and  others.  My  efforts  in  Israel  were  advanced  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">several  people,  including  Ariel  Szczupak  and  Yitzhak  Kerem;  Kerem  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  in  the  archives  in  Paris,  Washington,  and  New  York.  In  Germany,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  at  first  helped  by  Barbara  Haas,  Katrin  Reiser,  and  others,  but  then  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">many months by Thomas Kremer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  America,  I  was  assisted  by  the  accomplished  Holocaust  author  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ald  Schwab,  former  Nuremberg  Trial  investigator  Fred  Thieberger,  former </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allied  occupation  intelligence  officer  Werner  Michel,  business  ethics  profes- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor  Robert  Urekew,  and  researchers  Vanessa  van  der  Linde  and  Kathleen </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dyer-Williams, among many others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Holland,  research  depended  upon  two  doggedly  determined  univer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sity  students,  Willemijn  Ruberg  and  Martijn  Kraaij.  In  Poland,  we  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  enormously  by  the  devoted  assistance  of  Zbig  Kanski  and  others.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">France, Diane Goertz and several others undertook research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  translators  were  kind  enough  to  help,  and  of  course  always  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">rush  basis.  In  German,  two  of  the  most  important  were  Susan  Steiner  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inge  Wolfe,  both  of  whom  leapt  into  complex  technical  papers.  Aldona </p>
<p class="calibre1">Szostek-Pontchek  tackled  Polish.  Especially  diligent  was  the  French  transla- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  team,  including  Jackie  Holland,  Virginia  Rinaldi,  and  the  French  team </p>
<p class="calibre1">leader,  Terra  York;  when  these  fine  people  weren't  translating,  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">doing  double  duty  with  English  language  documentation.  On  the  Labor  Day </p>
<p class="calibre1">weekend  before  publication,  four  French  translators  in  four  cities  worked </p>
<p class="calibre1">day and night to help unmask the facts in France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  team  of  extraordinary  researchers  worked  closely  with  me,  often  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">8  A.M.  to  midnight,  as  we  searched  through  stacks  of  documents  seeking </p>
<p class="calibre1">clues  and  connecting  dots.  There  was  no  rest  for  these  hard-working,  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">foundly  idealistic  people,  who  often  scrutinized  hundreds  of  documents  each </p>
<p class="calibre1">day as we checked and triple-checked every granule of the story. These </p>
<p class="calibre1">include Erica Ashton, Sally Murek and Derek Kulnis during the day. Volun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teer  David  Keleti,  a  genetic  engineer,  helped  bolster  the  nightshift  and  week- </p>
<p class="calibre1">end  efforts.  Keleti  in  particular  helped  us  assemble  the  murky  facts  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  in  Sweden  and  Switzerland.  Susan  Cooke  Anastasi,  our  tireless  copy </p>
<p class="calibre1">editor,  often  worked  the  overnight  shift;  whatever  errors  we  made  at  night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she would fix by morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  many  labored  hard,  without  two  heroic  individuals  this  book </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply  could  not  have  been  completed.  The  first  is  Niels  Cordes,  formerly  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  National  Archives  microfilm  room.  Cordes  is  one  of  the  most  methodical, </p>
<p class="calibre1">intuitive,  and  knowledgeable  historians  and  archivists  I  have  ever  met.  We </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked together in archives in New York, Washington, and London, and later </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  did  research  with  a  team  in  Berlin.  Cordes  translated  many  pages  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  documents.  He  never  failed  to  display  the  sharpest  insights  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">smallest details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  second  heroic  figure  is  Kai  Gloystein.  Gloystein  first  worked  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  project  in  archives  and  libraries  in  Bonn,  Cologne,  and  Berlin,  and  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">flew  to  America  to  help  finalize  the  project  working  fifteen-hour  days  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  fine  of  the  manuscript  and  thousands  of  footnotes.  He  also  translated </p>
<p class="calibre1">voluminous  documents,  contemporary  newspapers,  and  technical  journals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gloystein's  indefatigable  commitment  to  excellence,  precision  eye  for  detail </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  sharp  intellect  cast  a  profound  benefit  across  every  page  of  the  manu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">script. He was a warrior for perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  number  of  leading  historians  and  archivists  bestowed  great  contribu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  to  my  effort  through  their  advice,  searches  of  their  records,  assistance </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  recruiting  others,  and  special  accommodations.  These  men  and  women  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  stalwarts  of  history.  In  some  cases,  they  selflessly  offered  their  support, </p>
<p class="calibre1">talent,  and  insights  for  more  than  a  year.  In  Israel,  this  includes  Gilad  Livne </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Israel  State  Archives  who  gave  me  full  access  to the  Eichmann  papers, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rochelle  Rubinstein  at  Central  Zionist  Archives,  who  also  helped  during  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">visit  there.  In  Britain,  John  Klier  from  the  University  of  London  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  team  at  the  Public  Record  Office  rendered  continuing  assistance.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  Agnes  d'Angio  and  Herve  Vernon  of  the  French  Economic  Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">Archive  were  always  responsive.  In  Holland,  Erik  Somers  of  the  Institute  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">War  Documentation  assisted  for  many  months,  recruiting  interns  and  facili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tating research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Germany,  warm  friendship  and  assistance  was  extended  by  Ulrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soenius  at  Rheinisch-Westfalisches  Wirtschaftsarchiv  in  Cologne,  Peter  Grupp </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Politisches  Archiv  in  Bonn,  Gerhardt  Hirschfeld  of  Stuttgart's  Library  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary History, Johannes Tuchel of the Memorial for German Resis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance  in  Berlin,  as  well  as  Karola  Wagner,  Anette  Meiburg,  Siegfried  Buttner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  entire  staff  at  Bundesarchiv  in  Lichterfelde.  In  Poland,  Jan  Jagielski </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Warsaw's  Jewish  Historical  Institute  and  Franciszek  Piper  at  the  Auschwitz </p>
<p class="calibre1">Museum both found time in their overworked schedule to locate materials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  United  States,  Marek  Web  helped  me  at  YIVO  archives.  Michael </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nash  at  Hagley  Museum  extended  scholar-in-residence  privileges  that  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  helpful.  Henry  Mayer  and  Aaron  Kornblum  at  the  United  States  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust  Museum  made  a  big  difference  to  our  demanding  research.  At  the  Na- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  Archives,  I  was  blessed  to  encounter  a  group  of  irreplaceable  archivists </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  staffers,  including  John  Taylor  (OSS),  Milt  Gustafson  (State  De- </p>
<p class="calibre1">partment),  Fred  Romanski  (Justice),  Greg  Bradsher  (Holocaust-Era  Assets), </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louis  Holland  (captured  Nazi  microfilms),  Marie  Carpenti,  and  many  others </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  reading  room;  these  men  and  women  worked  with  me  for  a  year.  They </p>
<p class="calibre1">are the precious vanguard of America's effort to preserve its history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  who  read  this  book  will  see  the  influence  of  my  pre-publication </p>
<p class="calibre1">reader  reviewers,  each  with  their  own  broad  or  niche  expertise.  Each  read </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  entire  manuscript  and  most  proffered  extensive  marginal  notes.  The  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">viewers  included  Robert  Wolfe  (Nazi  documentation),  Abraham  Peck  (Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust  history),  Henry  Mayer  (Holocaust  documentation),  Greg  Bradsher </p>
<p class="calibre1">(trading  with  the  enemy),  Werner  Michel  (Allied  intelligence  and  Nazi  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology),  Fred  Thieberger  (Nuremberg  war  crimes  investigation),  Gerhard </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hirschfeld  (Holocaust  in  Holland),  Erik  Somers  (Holocaust  in  Holland), </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob  Moore  (Holocaust  in  Holland),  Esther  Finder  (survivor  issues),  Robert </p>
<p class="calibre1">Urekew  (business  ethics),  Bradley  Kliewer  (technology),  Shlomo  Aronson </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Reich  security  and  Nazi  methodology),  John  Klier  (Holocaust  studies  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian  history),  Byron  Sherwin  (ethics  during  the  Holocaust),  and  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">others  in  the  fields  of  history,  financial  crimes,  accountancy  and  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">practices, who gave me the gift of their time and counsel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  readers  and  reviewers  helped  me  achieve  greater  precision.  But  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  mention  must  go  to  four  of  the  finest  minds  on  the  period:  Robert </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paxton  (Vichy  France),  William  Seltzer  (Holocaust  census  and  statistics  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology),  Niels  Cordes  (German  history  and  Nazi  documentation),  and  Erik </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somers  (Holland).  They  influenced  the  manuscript  in  profound  ways,  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">measurably sharpening its precision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  received  telephonic  assistance  from  Radu  Ioanid  (Holocaust  in  Roma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nia), Henry Friedlander (sterilization and euthanasia), and many others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  dozens  worked  hard  to  advance  my  work,  two  eminent </p>
<p class="calibre1">scholars  made  a  towering  contribution.  The  first  is  Sybil  Milton,  who  helped </p>
<p class="calibre1">initialize my research. Milton, former historian with the United States Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust Museum, had crusaded for years to discover the connections between </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM,  its  Holleriths,  and  the  Holocaust.  She  warned  me  the  road  would  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  easy.  Her  original  guiding  efforts  launched  me  along  the  correct  path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  Sybil  passed  away  before  the  project  was  completed.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">book  is  a  testament  to  the  pillar  of  Holocaust  expertise  she  has  represented </p>
<p class="calibre1">for decades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  other  is  Robert  Wolfe,  rightly  at  the  very  pinnacle  of  the  world's </p>
<p class="calibre1">respected  experts  in  Holocaust  and  captured  Nazi  documents.  Wolfe  granted </p>
<p class="calibre1">me  his  time  and  unparalleled  expertise  for  over  a  year,  constantly  guiding </p>
<p class="calibre1">me,  prodding  me,  and  assisting  me  in  pursuit  of  the  most  complete  and  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cisely  documented  story  possible.  Wolfe  is  a  tireless  warrior  for  truth  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust  documentation  and  accountability.  His  legendary  reputation  among </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world's  archivists  and  historians  is  richly  deserved.  His  stamp  on  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">book and my efforts is unmistakable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History  also  recognizes  that  without  a  small  group  committed  to  uncov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ering  the  truth,  this  book  would  have  never  been  written.  These  people </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  the  difference:  Aron  Hirt-Manheimer,  Arthur  Herzberg,  and  Lawrence </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schiffman, as well as Wolfe and Milton. Without their courage and stamina, it </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply could not have been done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assembling  the  facts  was  ironically  only  half  the  struggle.  Publishing </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  facts  took  a  historic  bravery  and  literary  fearlessness  that  many  lacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the head of the line is Philip Turner, formerly of Times Books, who acquired </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  the  Holocaust  for  Random  House.  Then,  for  almost  eight  months,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  closely  supported—hour  to  hour—by  Crown  vice  president  and  senior </p>
<p class="calibre1">editor  Douglas  Pepper,  who  bonded  with  the  text  and  the  mission  to  boldly </p>
<p class="calibre1">tell this unknown  story  to the  world.  During  the  past  thirty  years of investiga- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive  reporting  and  publishing,  I  have  learned  to  quickly  identify  the  genuine </p>
<p class="calibre1">pros.  Pepper  and  the  entire  team  at  Crown,  all  under  the  baton  of  Crown </p>
<p class="calibre1">editorial  director  Steve  Ross,  never  shirked.  Others,  such  as  William  Adams, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitney  Cookman,  and  Tina  Constable  worked  for  precision  and  excellence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  first  moment,  they  mobilized  the  commitment  and  courage  to  place </p>
<p class="calibre1">the full weight of Crown behind the project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crown's  commitment  was  equaled  overseas  by  some  of  the  most  distin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">guished  editors  and  publishers  of  Europe  and  Latin  America.  All  of  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">embarked  upon  the  year-long  process  of  chapter-by-chapter  translation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  extended  their  support  to  me  as  an  author  and  collectively  joined  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">see  this  book  become  a  worldwide  phenomenon.  Many  became  friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  include  Margit  Ketterle  and  Christian  Seeger  of  Germany's  Propylaen </p>
<p class="calibre1">Verlag (Econ/Ullstein/List); Abel Gerschenfeld of France's Editions Robert </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laffont;  Paolo  Zaninoni  of  Italy's  RCS  Libri/Rizzoli;  Liesbeth  de  Vries  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holland's  Kosmos  Z&amp;K;  Zbig  Kanski  of  Poland's  Graal  Agency  and  Ewelina </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osinska  of  Muza;  Claudio  Rothmuller  and  Paul  Christoph  of  Brazil's  Editora </p>
<p class="calibre1">Campus  for  the  Portuguese-speaking  countries,  and  Jorge  Naveiro  of  Argen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tina's  Adantida  for  the  Spanish-speaking  countries.  British  publisher  Little, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown  &amp;  Company  UK,  and  its  distinguished  editorial  director,  Alan  Sam- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son, completed the book's global reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  book  received  the  attention  of  the  world's  great  publishers  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  the  untiring  efforts  of  one  person,  my  agent,  Lynne  Rabinoff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynne's  confidence  in  me  and  the  project  was  the  dominant  force  behind  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">book  assuming  a  global  scope.  She  fought  valiandy—hour  to  hour—to  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">serve  the  quality  and  integrity  of  the  final  product.  She  was  tireless  in  her </p>
<p class="calibre1">efforts  to  bring  this  story  to  light  in  the  most  powerful  fashion,  and  to  ensure </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  it  would  reach  not  only  the  halls  of  academia,  but  readers  in  some  fifty </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  the  book  will  appear  in.  These  few  words  cannot  express  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">respect  for  her  as  the  best  agent  any  author  could  ever  have.  As  a  result  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynne's energies and faith, this book became a reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  I  was  always  surrounded  by  researchers  and  translators,  craft- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  product  required  the  continuous  and  highly  amplified  creative  assis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tance  of  Hans  Zimmer,  Jerry  Goldsmith,  John  Barry,  BT,  Moby,  Tangerine </p>

<p class="calibre1">THIS   BOOK WILL BE  PROFOUNDLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO  READ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT  WAS  profoundly  uncomfortable  to  write.  It  tells  the  story  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious  involvement—directly  and  through  its  subsidiaries—in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holocaust,  as  well  as  its  involvement  in  the  Nazi  war  machine  that  murdered </p>
<p class="calibre1">millions of others throughout Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mankind  barely  noticed  when  the  concept  of  massively  organized  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation  quiedy  emerged  to  become  a  means  of  social  control,  a  weapon  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">war,  and  a  roadmap  for  group  destruction.  The  unique  igniting  event  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  fateful  day  of  the  last  century,  January  30,  1933,  the  day  Adolf  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  to  power.  Hitler  and  his  hatred  of  the  Jews  was  the  ironic  driving  force </p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  this  intellectual  turning  point.  But  his  quest  was  gready  enhanced </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  energized  by  the  ingenuity  and  craving  for  profit  of  a  single  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  and  its  legendary,  autocratic  chairman.  That  company  was  Interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional Business Machines, and its chairman was Thomas J. Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Der  Fuhrer's  obsession  with  Jewish  destruction  was  hardly  original.  There </p>
<p class="calibre1">had been czars and tyrants before him. But for the first time in history, an anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semite had automation on his side. Hitler didn't do it alone. He had help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  upside-down  world  of  the  Holocaust,  dignified  professionals </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  Hitler's  advance  troops.  Police  officials  disregarded  their  duty  in  favor </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  protecting  villains  and  persecuting  victims.  Lawyers  perverted  concepts  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">justice  to  create  anti-Jewish  laws.  Doctors  defiled  the  art  of  medicine  to  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">petrate  ghasdy  experiments  and  even  choose  who  was  healthy  enough  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  to  death—and  who  could  be  cost-effectively  sent  to  the  gas  chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists and engineers debased their higher calling to devise the instruments </p>
<p class="calibre1">7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  rationales  of  destruction.  And  statisticians  used  t h e i r   little  known  bill </p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful  discipline  to  identify  the  victims,  project  and  rationalize  the  bene- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fits  of  their  destruction,  organize  their  persecution,  and  even  audit  the  effi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ciency of genocide. Enter IBM and its overseas subsidiaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solipsistic  and  dazzled  by  its  own  swirling  universe  of  technical  possi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bilities,  IBM  was  self-gripped  by  a  special  amoral  corporate  mantra:  if  it  can </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  done,  it  should  be  done.  To  the  blind  technocrat,  the  means  were  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  than  the  ends.  The  destruction  of  the  Jewish  people  became  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  important  because  the  invigorating  nature  of  IBM's  technical  achieve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  was  only  heightened  by  the  fantastical  profits  to  be  made  at  a  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">when bread lines stretched across the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So how did it work? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Hitler  came  to  power,  a  central  Nazi  goal  was  to  identify  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy  Germany's  600,000-member  Jewish  community.  To  Nazis,  Jews  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  just  those  who  practiced  Judaism,  but  those  of  Jewish  blood,  regardless </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  their  assimilation,  intermarriage,  religious  activity,  or  even  conversion  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity.  Only  after  Jews  were  identified  could  they  be  targeted  for  asset </p>
<p class="calibre1">confiscation,  ghettoization,  deportation,  and  ultimately  extermination.  To </p>
<p class="calibre1">search  generations  of  communal,  church,  and  governmental  records  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">across  Germany—and  later  throughout  Europe—was  a  cross-indexing  task </p>
<p class="calibre1">so monumental, it called for a computer. But in 1933, no computer existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  Reich  needed  to  mount  a  systematic  campaign  of  Jewish  eco- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nomic  disenfranchisement  and  later  began  the  massive  movement  of  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean  Jews  out  of  their  homes  and  into  ghettos,  once  again,  the  task  was  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">prodigious it called for a computer. But in 1933, no computer existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  Final  Solution  sought  to  efficiently  transport  Jews  out  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  ghettos  along  railroad  lines  and  into  death  camps,  with  timing  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">precise  the  victims  were  able  to  walk  right  out  of  the  boxcar  and  into  a  wait- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing gas chamber, the coordination was so complex a task, this too called for a </p>
<p class="calibre1">computer. But in 1933, no computer existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  another  invention  did  exist:  the  IBM  punch  card  and  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorting  system—a  precursor  to  the  computer.  IBM,  primarily  through  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  subsidiary,  made  Hitler's  program  of  Jewish  destruction  a  techno- </p>
<p class="calibre1">logic  mission  the  company  pursued  with  chilling  success.  IBM  Germany, </p>
<p class="calibre1">using  its  own  staff  and  equipment,  designed,  executed,  and  supplied  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">indispensable  technologic  assistance  Hitler's  Third  Reich  needed  to  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plish  what  had  never  been  done  before—the  automation  of  human  destruc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  More  than  2,000  such  multi-machine  sets  were  dispatched  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany, and thousands more throughout German-dominated Europe. Card </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  Dehomag  Hollerith  machine.  (Photograph  courtesy  United  States  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorting operations were established in every major concentration camp. People </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  moved  from  place  to  place,  systematically  worked  to  death,  and  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">remains cataloged with icy automation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Germany,  known  in  those  days  as  Deutsche  Hollerith  Maschinen </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gesellschaft,  or  Dehomag,  did  not  simply  sell  the  Reich  machines  and  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">walk  away.  IBM's  subsidiary,  with  the  knowledge  of  its  New  York  headquar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters,  enthusiastically  custom-designed  the  complex  devices  and  specialized </p>
<p class="calibre1">applications  as  an  official  corporate  undertaking.  Dehomag's  top  manage- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  was  comprised  of  openly  rabid  Nazis  who  were  arrested  after  the  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  their  Party  affiliation.  IBM  NY  always  understood—from  the  outset  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1933—that  it  was  courting  and  doing  business  with  the  upper  echelon  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  Party.  The  company  leveraged  its  Nazi  Party  connections  to  continu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ously  enhance  its  business  relationship  with  Hitler's  Reich,  in  Germany  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout Nazi-dominated Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  and  other  IBM  subsidiaries  custom-designed  the  applica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  Its  technicians  sent  mock-ups  of  punch  cards  back  and  forth  to  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices until the data columns were acceptable, much as any software designer </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  today.  Punch  cards  could  only  be  designed,  printed,  and  purchased </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  one  source:  IBM.  The  machines  were  not  sold,  they  were  leased,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">regularly maintained and upgraded by only one source: IBM. IBM subsidiaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">trained  the  Nazi  officers  and  their  surrogates  throughout  Europe,  set  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">branch  offices  and  local  dealerships  throughout  Nazi  Europe  stalled  by  a  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">volving  door  of  IBM  employees,  and  scoured  paper  mills  to  produce  as  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  1.5  billion  punch  cards  a  year  in  Germany  alone.  Moreover,  the  fragile </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  were  serviced  on  site  about  once  per  month,  even  when  that  site </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  in  or  near  a  concentration  camp.  IBM  Germany's  headquarters  in  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained  duplicates  of  many  code  books,  much  as  any  IBM  service  bureau </p>
<p class="calibre1">today would maintain data backups for computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  was  haunted  by  a  question  whose  answer  has  long  eluded  historians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Germans  always  had  the  lists  of  Jewish  names.  Suddenly,  a  squadron  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">grim-faced  SS  would  burst  into  a  city  square  and  post  a  notice  demanding </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  listed  assemble  the  next  day  at  the  train  station  for  deportation  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">East.  But  how  did  the  Nazis  get  the  lists?  For  decades,  no  one  has  known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few have asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  answer:  IBM  Germany's  census  operations  and  similar  advanced </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  counting  and  registration  technologies.  IBM  was  founded  in  1896  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  inventor  Herman  Hollerith  as  a  census  tabulating  company.  Cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  was  its  business.  But  when  IBM  Germany  formed  its  philosophical  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">technologic  alliance  with  Nazi  Germany,  census  and  registration  took  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  mission.  IBM  Germany  invented  the  racial  census—listing  not  just  reli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gious  affiliation,  but  bloodline  going  back  generations.  This  was  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">data lust. Not just to count the Jews—but to identify them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  and  asset  registration  was  only  one  of  the  many  uses  Nazi  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  found  for  high-speed  data  sorters.  Food  allocation  was  organized </p>
<p class="calibre1">around  databases,  allowing  Germany  to  starve  the  Jews.  Slave  labor  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified,  tracked,  and  managed  largely  through  punch  cards.  Punch  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  made  the  trains  run  on  time  and  cataloged  their  human  cargo.  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railway,  the  Reichsbahn,  Dehomag's  biggest  customer,  dealt  directly  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">senior  management  in  Berlin.  Dehomag  maintained  punch  card  installations </p>
<p class="calibre1">at train depots across Germany, and eventually across all Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  much  did  IBM  know?  Some  of  it  IBM  knew  on  a  daily  basis </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  the  twelve-year  Reich.  The  worst  of  it  IBM  preferred  not  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">know—"don't ask, don't tell" was the order of the day. Yet  IBM NY officials, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  frequently  Watson's  personal  representatives,  Harrison  Chauncey  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Werner  Lier,  were  almost  constantly  in  Berlin  or  Geneva,  monitoring  activi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties, ensuring that the parent company in New York  was not cut out of any of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  profits  or  business  opportunities  Nazism  presented.  When  U.S.  law  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  direct  contact  illegal,  IBM's  Swiss  office  became  the  nexus,  providing </p>
<p class="calibre1">the New York office continuous information and credible deniability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly,  the  dynamics  and  context  of  IBM's  alliance  with  Nazi  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  changed  throughout  the  twelve-year  Reich.  I  want  the  full  story  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stood  in  context.  Skipping  around  in  th e   book  will  only  lead  to  flawed  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">erroneous  conclusions.  So  if  you  intend  to  skim,  or  rely  on  selected  sections, </p>
<p class="calibre1">please  do  not  read  the  hook  at  a l l .   Make  no  mistake—the  Holocaust  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">still  have  occurred  without  IBM.  To  think  otherwise  is  more  than  wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Holocaust  would  have  proceeded—and  often  did  proceed—with  simple </p>
<p class="calibre1">bullets,  death  marches,  and  massacres  based  on  pen  and  paper  persecution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  there  is  reason  to  examine  the  fantastical  numbers  Hitler  achieved  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">murdering  so  many  millions  so  swiftly,  and  identify  the  crucial  role  of  auto- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation and technology. Accountability is needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  made  me  demand  answers  to  the  unasked  questions  about  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Holocaust?  I  confronted  the  reality  of  IBM's  involvement  one  day  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">1993  in  Washington  at  the  United  States  Holocaust  Museum.  There,  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  first  exhibit,  an  IBM  Hollerith  D-11  card  sorting  machine—riddled  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuits,  slots,  and  wires—was  prominently  displayed.  Clearly  affixed  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine's  front  panel  glistened  an  IBM  nameplate.  It  has  since  been  replaced </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  smaller  IBM  machine  because  so  many  people  congregated  around  it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating  a  bottleneck.  The  exhibit  explained  little  more  than  that  IBM  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible  for  organizing  the  census  of  1933  that  first  identified  the  Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  had  been  tight-lipped  about  its  involvement  with  Nazi  Germany.  So </p>
<p class="calibre1">although  15  million  people,  including  most  major  Holocaust  experts,  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">seen  the  display,  and  in  spite  of  the  best  efforts  of  leading  Museum  his- </p>
<p class="calibre1">torians,  little  more  was  understood  about  this  provocative  display  other  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  brief  curator's  description  at  the  exhibit  and  a  few  pages  of  supportive </p>
<p class="calibre1">research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  still  remember  staring  at  the  machine  for  an  hour,  and  the  moment </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  I  turned  to  my  mother  and  father  who  accompanied  me  to  the  museum </p>
<p class="calibre1">that day and promised them I would discover more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My  parents  are  Holocaust  survivors,  uprooted  from  their  homes  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland.  My  mother  escaped  from  a  boxcar  en  route  to  Treblinka,  was  shot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  then  buried  in  a  shallow  mass  grave.  My  father  had  already  run  away </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  a  guarded  line  of  Jews  and  discovered  her  leg  protruding  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">snow.  By  moonlight  and  by  courage,  these  two  escapees  survived  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cold,  the  hunger,  and  the  Reich.  Standing  next  to  me  five  decades  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  image  within  the  reflection  of  the  exhibit  glass,  shrapnel  and  bullet </p>
<p class="calibre1">fragments  permanendy  embedded  in  their  bodies,  my  parents  could  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">express confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I had other questions. The Nazis had my parents' names. How? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was the connection of t h i s  gleaming black, beige  and silver </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine,  squatting  silently  in  this  dimly  lit  museum,  to  the  millions  of  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  Europeans  who  were  murdered—and  murdered  not  just  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">chaotic  split-second  as  a  casualty  of  war,  but  in  a  grotesque  and  protracted </p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve-year  campaign  of  highly  organized  humiliation,  dehumanization,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then ultimately extermination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  years  after  that  chance  discovery,  I  was  shadowed  by  the  realization </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  IBM  was  somehow  involved  in  the  Holocaust  in  technologic  ways  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  not  yet  been  pieced  together.  Dots  were  everywhere.  The  dots  needed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be connected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing  that  International  Business  Machines  has  always  billed  itself </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  a  "solutions"  company,  I  understood  that  IBM  does  not  merely  wait  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">governmental  customers  to  call.  IBM  has  amassed  its  fortune  and  reputation </p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  because  it  generally  anticipates  governmental  and  corporate  needs </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  before  they  develop,  and  then  offers,  designs,  and  delivers  customized </p>
<p class="calibre1">solutions—even  if  it  must  execute  those  technologic  solutions  with  its  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">staff  and  equipment.  IBM  has  done  so  for  countless  government  agencies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate giants, and industrial associations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  years  I  promised  myself  I  would  one  day  answer  the  question:  How </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  solutions  did  IBM  provide  to  Nazi  Germany?  I  knew  about  the  initial </p>
<p class="calibre1">solution: the census. Just how far did the solutions go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1998,  I  began  an  obsessive  quest  for  answers.  Proceeding  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  foundation  funds,  organizational  grants,  or  publisher  dollars  behind  me,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">began  recruiting  a  team  of  researchers,  interns,  translators,  and  assistants,  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">on my own dime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon  a  network  developed  throughout  the  United  States,  as  well  as  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  Israel,  England,  Holland,  Poland,  and  France.  This  network  contin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ued  to  grow  as  time  went  on.  Holocaust  survivors,  children  of  survivors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">retirees,  and  students  with  no  connection  to  the  Holocaust—as  well  as  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fessional  researchers,  distinguished  archivists  and  historians,  and  even  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mer  Nuremberg  Trial  investigators—all  began  a  search  for  documentation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  more  than  100  people  participated,  some  for  months  at  a  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  for  just  a  few  hours  searching  obscure  Polish  documents  for  key </p>
<p class="calibre1">phrases.  Not  knowing  the  story,  they  searched  for  key  words:  census,  statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tics,  lists,  registrations,  railroads,  punch  cards,  and  a  roster  of  other  topics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  they  found  them,  the  material  was  copied  and  sent.  For  many  weeks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents were flowing in at the rate of 100 per day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  my  team  was  volunteers.  All  of  them  were  sworn  to  secrecy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each was shocked and saddened by the implications of the project and in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tensely motivated. A few said they could not sleep well for days after learning </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the connection. I was often sustained by their words of encouragement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  I  assembled  more  t h a n   20,000  pages  of  documentation  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty  archives,  library  manuscript  collections,  museum  files,  and  other  reposi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tories. In the process, I accessed thousands of formerly classified State Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  OSS,  or  other  previously  restricted  government  papers.  Other  obscure </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents  from  European  holdings  had  never  been  translated  or  connected </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  such  an  inquiry.  All  these  were  organized  in  my  own  central  archive  mir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">roring  the  original  archival  source  files.  We  also  scanned  and  translated  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  fifty  general  books  and  memoirs,  as  well  as  contemporary  technical  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific  journals  covering  punch  cards  and  statistics,  Nazi  publications,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspapers  of  the  era.  All  of  this  material—primary  documents,  journal  arti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cles,  newsclips,  and  book  extracts—were  cross-indexed  by  month.  We  cre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  one  manila  folder  for  every  month  from  1933  to  1950.  If  a  document </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred  to  numerous  dates,  it  was  cross-filed  in  the  numerous  monthly  fold- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers.  Then  all  contents  of  monthly  folders  were  further  cross-indexed  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow  topic  threads,  such  as  Warsaw  Ghetto,  German  Census,  Bulgarian </p>
<p class="calibre1">Railroads, Watson in Germany, Auschwitz, and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stacks  of  documents  organized  into  topics  were  arrayed  across  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">basement floor. As many as six people at a time busily shutded copies of doc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uments  from  one  topic  stack  to  another  from  morning  until  midnight.  One </p>
<p class="calibre1">document  might  be  copied  into  five  or  six  topic  stacks.  A  high-speed  copier </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  twenty-bin  sorter  was  installed.  Just  moving  from  place  to  place  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">basement involved hopscotching around document piles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  the  20,000  documents  were  flash  cards.  It  was  much  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">complex.  Examined  singly,  none  revealed  their  story.  Indeed,  most  of  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  profoundly  misleading  as  stand-alone  papers.  They  only  assumed  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">true  meaning  when  juxtaposed  with  numerous  other  related  documents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">often  from  totally  unrelated  sources.  In  other  words,  the  documents  were  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzle  pieces—the  picture  could  not  be  constructed  until  all  the  fragments </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  put  together.  For  example,  one  IBM  report  fleetingly  referred  to  a  "Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks"  as  fetching  an  IBM  machine  from  Dachau.  Not  until  I  juxtaposed </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  document  with  an  obscure  military  statistics  report  discovered  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Public Record Office in London did I learn who Sgt. Hendricks really was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Complicating  the  task,  many  of  the  IBM  papers  and  notes  were  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">signed  or  undated  carbons,  employing  deliberate  vagueness,  code  words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">catchphrases,  or  transient  corporate  shorthand.  I  had  to  learn  the  contempo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">raneous  lexicon  of  the  company  to  decipher  their  content.  I  would  study  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">stare at some individual documents for months until their meaning finally </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  clear  through  some  other  discovered  document.  For  example,  I  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">countered  an  IBM  reference  to  accumulating  "points."  Eventually,  I  discov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ered  that  "points"  referred  to  making  sales  quotas  for  inclusion  in  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundred  Percent  Club.  IBM  maintained  sales  quotas  for  all  its  subsidiaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">during the Hitler era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  a  key  revelation  did  not  occur  until  we  tracked  a  source </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  three  and  four  stages.  For  example,  I  reviewed  the  English  version  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  well-known  volume  Destruction  of  the  Dutch  Jews  by  Jacob  Presser.  I  found </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  on  my  subject.  I  then  asked  my  researchers  in  Holland  to  check  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutch  edition.  They  found  a  single  unfootnoted  reference  to  a  punch  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">system.  Only  by  checking  Presser's  original  typescript  did  we  discover  a  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ginal  notation  that  referenced  a  Dutch  archival  document  that  led  to  a  cas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cade  of  information  on  the  Netherlands.  In  reviewing  the  Romanian  census,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">commissioned  the  translation  of  a  German  statistician's  twenty-page  memoir </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  discover  a  single  sentence  confirming  that  punch  cards  were  used  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania.  That  information  was  juxtaposed  against  an  IBM  letter  confirming </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company  was  moving  machinery  from  war-torn  Poland  into  Romania  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">aid Romanian census operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  truest  sense,  the  story  of  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  has  been  shat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tered into thousands of shards. Only by piecing them  all together did I erect a </p>
<p class="calibre1">towering  picture  window  permitting  me  to  view  what  really  occurred.  That </p>
<p class="calibre1">verified account is retold in this book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  my  pursuit,  I  received  extraordinary  cooperation  from  every  private, </p>
<p class="calibre1">public,  and  governmental  source  in  every  country.  Sadly,  the  only  refusal </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  from  IBM  itself,  which  rebuffed  my  requests  for  access  to  documents </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  interviews.  I  was  not  alone.  Since  WWII,  the  company  has  steadfastly </p>
<p class="calibre1">refused  to  cooperate  with  outside  authors.  Virtually  every  recent  book  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM,  whether  written  by  esteemed  business  historians  or  ex-IBM  employees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">includes  a  reference  to  the  company's  refusal  to  cooperate  with  the  author  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  way.  Ultimately,  I  was  able  to  arrange  proper  access.  Hundreds  of  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">documents were placed at my disposal. I read them all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind  every  text  footnote  is  a  file  folder  with  all  the  hardcopy  docu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mentation  needed  to  document  every  sentence  in  this  book  at  a  moment's </p>
<p class="calibre1">notice.  Moreover,  I  assembled  a  team  of  hair-splitting,  nitpicking,  adversarial </p>
<p class="calibre1">researchers  and  archivists  to  review  each  and  every  sentence,  collectively </p>
<p class="calibre1">ensuring  that  each  fact  and  fragment  of  a  fact  was  backed  up  with  the  neces- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sary black and white documents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  reconstructing  the  facts,  I  was  guided  on  every  page  by  two  principles: </p>
<p class="calibre1">context and consequences. For instance, although I enjoyed access to vol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">umes of diplomatic and intelligence information, I was careful to concentrate </p>
<p class="calibre1">on what was known p u b l i c l y  in the media about atrocities and anti-Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions in Europe. For this reason, readers will notice an extraordinary </p>
<p class="calibre1">reliance  on  articles  in  the  New  York  Times.  I  quote  the  New  York  Times  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  it  was  the  newspaper  of  record  in  America,  but  because  IBM  execu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tives, including Thomas Watson, were headquartered in New York. Had they </p>
<p class="calibre1">lived in Chicago, I would have quoted the Chicago Tribune. Had they lived in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cleveland, I would have quoted the Cleveland Plain Dealer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Readers  will  also  notice  that  I  frequendy  relied  upon  reproducing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">exact  words  the  principals  themselves  used  in  telegrams,  letters,  or  telephone </p>
<p class="calibre1">transcripts.  Readers  can  judge  for  themselves  exactly  what  was  said  in  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">context. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  few  exceptions  (see  Bibliographical  Note),  the  Holocaust  litera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ture  is  virtually  devoid  of  mention  of  the  Hollerith  machines—in  spite  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  high  profile  display  at  the  United  States  Holocaust  Memorial  Museum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historians  should  not  be  defensive  about  the  absence  of  even  a  mention.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  documents  were  all  there,  but  there  are  literally  millions  of  frames  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">pages  of  Holocaust  documents  in  the  leading  archives  of  the  world.  Many  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">these  materials  had  simply  never  been  accessed,  many  have  not  been  avail- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able,  and  some  are  based  on  false  chronologies  or  appear  to  be  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">minutia.  Others  were  well  known,  such  as  Heydrich's  1939  instruction  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrating  Jewish  communities  near  railroad  tracks,  but  the  repeated  ref- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erences to census operations were simply overlooked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  the  obscurity  of  the  documents,  such  an  investigation  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">require  expertise  in  the  history  of  the  Holocaust  before  and  after  the  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">began,  the  history  of  post-Industrial  Revolution  mechanization,  the  history </p>
<p class="calibre1">of technology, and more specifically the archaic punch card system, as well as </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  understanding  of  Reich  economics,  multi-national  corporations,  and  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">grasp  of  financial  collusion.  In  addition,  one  would  need  to  juxtapose  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">information  for  numerous  countries  before  assembling  the  complete  picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  important  is  the  fact  that  until  I  examined  the  IBM  documents,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">half  of  the  screen  was  totally  obscured.  Again,  the  documents  do  not  speak </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  themselves,  only  in  ensemble.  I  was  fortunate  to  have  an  understanding  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  economics  and  multi-national  commerce  from  my  earlier  book,  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transfer  Agreement,  as  well  as  a  background  in  the  computer  industry,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  of  experience  as  an  investigative  journalist  specializing  in  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">misconduct.  I  approached  this  project  as  a  typical  if  not  grandiose  investiga- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  corporate  conduct  with  one  dramatic  difference:  the  conduct  impacted </p>
<p class="calibre1">on the lives and deaths of millions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gathering  my  pre  publication  expert  reviewers  was  a  process  in  itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  sought  not  only  the  leading  historians  of  the  Holocaust,  but  niche  experts </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  such  topics  as  Vichy  France,  Romania,  and  census  and  persecution.  But  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  consulted  business  historians,  technical  specialists,  accountants,  legal </p>
<p class="calibre1">sources  on  reparations  and  corporate  war  crimes,  an  investigator  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">original  Nuremberg  prosecution  team,  a  wartime  military  intelligence  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology  expert,  and  even  an  ex-FBI  special  agent  with  expertise  in  financial </p>
<p class="calibre1">crimes. I wanted the prismatic view of all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Changing  perspective  was  perhaps  the  dominant  reason  why  the  rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tionship  between  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  has  never  been  explored.  When  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">first wrote The Transfer Agreement in 1984, no one wanted to focus on assets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  everyone  talks  about  the  assets.  The  formative  years  for  most  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">scholarship  was  before  the  computer  age,  and  well  before  the  Age  of  Infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation.  Everyone  now  possesses  an  understanding  of  how  technology  can  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">utilized  in  the  affairs  of  war  and  peace.  We  can  now  go  back  and  look  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">same documentation in a new light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  of  us  have  become  enraptured  by  the  Age  of  Computerization </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Age  of  Information.  I  know  I  have.  But  now  I  am  consumed  with  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">new awareness that, for me, as the son of Holocaust survivors, brings  me to a </p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  new  consciousness.  I  call  it  the  Age  of  Realization,  as  we  look  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  examine  technology's  wake.  Unless  we  understand  how  the  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">acquired the names, more lists will be compiled against more people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  story  of  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  just  a  beginning.  I  could  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">written  twenty  books  with  the  documents  I  uncovered,  one  for  every  country </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Europe.  I  estimate  there  are  100,000  more  documents  scattered  in  base- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  and  corporate  archives  around  the  United  States  and  Europe.  Corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  archivists  should  take  note:  these  documents  are  related  to  a  crime  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">must  not  be  moved,  tampered  with,  or  destroyed.  They  must  be  transferred </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  those  appropriate  archival  institutions  that  can  assure  immediate  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">undelayed  access  to  scholars  and  war  crimes  prosecutors  so  the  accountabil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity process can continue (see Major Sources). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  through  exposing  and  examining  what  really  occurred  can  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world of technology finally adopt the well-worn motto: Never Again. </p>
