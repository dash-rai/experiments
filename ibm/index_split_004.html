<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">1 NUMBERED PEOPLE </h3>

<p class="calibre1">VEILS  OF  SMOKE  HUNG  ABOVE.  MANY  OF  THE  EXHAUSTED </p>
<p class="calibre1">prisoners,  insensate  from  torture  and  starvation,  slumped  lifelessly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">fade </p>
<p class="calibre1">into </p>
<p class="calibre1">death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But </p>
<p class="calibre1">most </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">60,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">human </p>
<p class="calibre1">beings  squeezed  into  this  unimaginable  clearing  amongst  the  ever- </p>
<p class="calibre1">greens  were  still  running  from  place  to  place,  performing  assigned </p>
<p class="calibre1">chores  quickly,  proving  their  strength  and  viability  for  yet  an- </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  day  of  existence.  Surviving  the  moment  was  their  quest.1  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">nightmare  was  Bergen-Belsen  concentration  camp,  a  special  Hell  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth created by Nazi Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  rear  of  the  camp,  just  meters  from  its  back  fence,  stood  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">solitary  guard  tower.  Its  cross-barred  wooden  frame  rose  some  25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">feet  in  the  air.  Looking  down  from  this  commanding  perch,  one  saw </p>
<p class="calibre1">three  orderly  rows  of  wooden  barracks  down  to  the  right.  Along </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  left  lay  kitchens,  workshops,  storage  areas,  and  latrines  haphaz- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ardly  arrayed  between  curved,  muddy  lanes.  This  length  of  incar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceration  all  terminated  several  hundred  meters  away  at  the  gate </p>
<p class="calibre1">leading  to  the  camp  commandant's  office  and  the  SS  encampment.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">barbed-wire  perimeter  gave  the  camp  definition  even  as  a  series  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">internal  fences  straddling  patrol  aisles  segmented  the  cruel  confines </p>
<p class="calibre1">into six sub-camps.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just </p>
<p class="calibre1">below </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rear </p>
<p class="calibre1">watchtower, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a </p>
<p class="calibre1">round-topped </p>
<p class="calibre1">furnace </p>
<p class="calibre1">squatted  atop  the  mud.  Black  and  elongated,  the  furnace  resembled </p>
<p class="calibre1">a locomotive engine, but with two weighty kiln doors at the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  single,  tall,  sooty  smokestack  rose  several  meters  into  the  air.  A  hand </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  metal  stretcher  of sorts,  used  to slide emaciated  corpses into the flames, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  always  nearby.  Here  was  the  crematorium.  Not  hidden  out  of  sight,  nor </p>
<p class="calibre1">obscured  by  structures  or  berms,  the  crematorium  was  close  enough  to  burn </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  eyes  of  any  SS  guard  stationed  in  the  watchtower.  The  ominous  structure </p>
<p class="calibre1">and its message were visible to all as the final way station should fate falter— </p>
<p class="calibre1">or deliver.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Situated  between  two  rivers  and  the  towns  Bergen  and  Belsen,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">site  was  originally  established  in  spring  1943  as  a  prisoner  transit  camp  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">10,000  Jews  who  might  be  ransomed  or  traded.  But  in  the  last  months  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944  and  early  1945,  as  Nazi  death  camps,  including  Auschwitz,  were  liber- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  by  the  Allies,  Belsen  became  a  nightmare  of  human  consolidation,  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceiving  transports  from  other  sites.  By  spring  1945,  more  than  40,000  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">imprisoned  under  indescribable  conditions.  Starved,  worked  to  death,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">randomly  tortured,  the  death  toll  rose  to  nearly  20,000  just  for  the  month  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">March  1945.  After  liberation,  horrified  British  medical  teams  were  unable  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">save  some  14,000  dying  souls.  Eventually  bulldozers  were  deployed  to  grue- </p>
<p class="calibre1">somely shovel bodies into trenches of twisted rigor mortis.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  meters  from  the  Belsen  crematorium,  off  to  the  left,  near  the  kitch- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ens  and  the  cisterns,  down  a  muddy  path,  stood  the  block  leader's  house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inmates  sometimes  called  this  place  "the  lion's  den."  Within  "the  lion's  den" </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  room  for  the  Arbeitsdienstfuhrer,  the  Labor  Service  Leader.  That  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  the  Hollerith  punch  cards  were  processed.  At  first  glance,  they  seemed </p>
<p class="calibre1">like  simple  rectangular  cards,  five  and  a  quarter  inches  long,  three  and  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter  inches  tall,  divided  into  numbered  columns  with  holes  punched  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">various rows.5 But they were much more than simple cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning  in  December  1944,  a  Dutch  Jew,  Rudolf  Cheim,  was  assigned </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  work  in  the  Labor  Service  Office.  Hungry  and  desperate  to  stay  warm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheim  tried  every  cold  morning  to  locate  a  bit  of  extra  food  and  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">matches  to  make  a  fire.  Kindling  was  stacked  in  the  office.  But  no  matches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  those,  Cheim  needed  to  venture  into  the  other  room  where  the  SS  offic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers  slouched  on  chairs.  Invariably,  they  viciously  punched  him  in  the  face  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  price  for  walking  near  to  obtain  a  match.  But  it  was  worth  it  for  Cheim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could survive.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working  in  the  Arbeitsdienst  was  good.  The  Labor  Service  Office  held </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  power  of  life  or  death  over  prisoners,  including  him.  If  an  inmate  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">work,  he  could  live.  Cheim  was  happy  for  an  office  assignment  working  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Hollerith punch cards and their coded numbers. But as he did, he silendy </p>
<p class="calibre1">observed  through  the  corner  of  his  eye  the  SS  men  a d mi n i s t e r i n g  the  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorting procedure. For five weeks he look mental notes.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  Cheim  learned  the  method.  Every  day,  transports  of  slave  la- </p>
<p class="calibre1">borers  were  received.  Prisoners  were  identified  by  descriptive  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,  each  with  columns  and  punched  holes  detailing  nationality,  date  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">birth,  marital  status,  number  of  children,  reason  for  incarceration,  physical </p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics,  and  work  skills.  Sixteen  coded  categories  of  prisoners  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">listed  in  columns  3  and  4,  depending  upon  the  hole  position:  hole  3  signified </p>
<p class="calibre1">homosexual,  hole  9  for  anti-social,  hole  12  for  Gypsy.  Hole  8  designated  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew.  Printouts  based  on  the  cards  listed  the  prisoners  by  personal  code  num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber as well.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Column  34  was  labeled  "Reason  for  Departure."  Code  2  simply  meant </p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred  to  another  camp  for  continuing  labor.  Natural  death  was  coded  3. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Execution  was  coded  4.  Suicide  coded  5.  The  ominous  code  6  designated </p>
<p class="calibre1">"special  handling,"  the  term  commonly  understood  as  extermination,  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">in a gas chamber, by hanging, or by gunshot.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  some  two  years  as  the  trains  and  trucks  rolled  in  from  Belgium, </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  and  Holland,  thousands  of  punch  cards  were  examined,  processed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  information  fed  back  to  the  Department  of  Statistics  at  the  SS  Eco- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nomics  Office  in  Oranienburg.  The  numbered  men  and  women  were  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pared  to  a  list  of  work  needs  at  Bergen-Belsen  and  other  camps.  "Never  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">name,"  Cheim  remembers,  "only  the  assigned  numbers."  How  many  died  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  a  statistic  to  note,  a  detail  for  the  machines  to  digest.  That  December </p>
<p class="calibre1">1944,  some  20,000  prisoners  were  registered;  50  deaths  per  day,  on  average, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were recorded on punch cards.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheim  learned  that  to  discover  the  occupational  make-up  of  a  prisoner </p>
<p class="calibre1">group,  each  inmate's  individual  punch  card  was  fed  into  the  mechanical </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorter.  Then  the  dials  were  adjusted  to  isolate  certain  professions,  labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">skills,  age  groups,  or  language  abilities  needed  for  work  battalions.  If  prison- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers  were  selected  for  work,  their  names  appeared  on  a  Hollerith  printout  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">transport to nearby sub-camps, factories, and even local farms.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Labor  requirements  were  reported  and  then  matched  by  Office  D  II </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  SS  Economics  Office,  which  administered  all  the  camps  under  Gen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oswald  Pohl.  Pohl,  creator  of  the  "Extermination  by  Labor"  program,  ar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dently  argued  that  expeditiously  gassing  Jews  deprived  the  Reich  of  an  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portant  resource.  His  idea,  "Extermination  by  Labor,"  quite  simply  meant </p>
<p class="calibre1">working  Jews  to  death.  Only  after  outliving  their  usefulness  would  they  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">deported to death camps for gassing. Office D II embraced SS Chief Heinrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler's  declaration:  "If  10,000  Russian  females  collapse  from  exhaustion </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  digging  a  tank  ditch,  it  interests  me  only  so  far  as  the  tank  ditch  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">completed for Germany."12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheim  took  special  notice  one  day  when  five  women  escaped  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bergen-Belsen.  Angry  SS  guards  vowed  to  recapture  them.  They  resented </p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting  the  prisoner  departures  in  column  34  of  the  punch  card  forms  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">code 7—escaped.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  became  fascinated  with  a  young  Dutch  seamstress.  Who  was  she? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  journey  began  in  the  Westerbork  camp.  Went  to  Auschwitz.  She  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">born  May  10,  1924.  No  name.  Just  a  number.  53752.  But  who  was  53752, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheim wondered? Did she not have a name, only a number?14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheim  soon  began  to  understand  the  truth.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">human  beings  were  being  identified,  sorted,  assigned,  and  transported  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">means  of  the  Hollerith  system.  Numbers  and  punch  cards  had  dehumanized </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  all,  he  thought.  Numbers  and  punch  cards  would  probably  kill  them  all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Cheim never understood where the Hollerith system came from.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  December  morning,  even  as  the  numbered  man  Cheim,  in  his  tat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tered  uniform,  stepped  quickly  toward  the  Bergen-Belsen  Hollerith  office  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">stay  warm  and  to  stay  alive,  another  man,  this  one  dressed  elegantly  in  a  fine </p>
<p class="calibre1">suit and warm overcoat, stepped out of a new chauffeured car at 590 Madison </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avenue in New York. He was Thomas J. Watson. His company, IBM—one of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  biggest  in  the  world—custom-designed  and  leased  the  Hollerith  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorting  system  to  the  Third  Reich  for  use  at  Bergen-Belsen  and  most  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  concentration  camps.  International  Business  Machines  also  serviced  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  almost  monthly,  and  trained  Nazi  personnel  to  use  the  intricate  sys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tems.  Duplicate  copies  of code  books  were  kept  in  IBM's  offices in  case  field </p>
<p class="calibre1">books were lost. What's  more, his  company  was the exclusive source for up to </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.5 billion punch cards the Reich required each year to run its machines.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  systems  were  not  only  used  in  the  concentration  camps,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds  of  them  had  been  installed  for  years  throughout  the  entire  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercial,  industrial,  war-making,  and  anti-Jewish  infrastructure  of  Nazi  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many and Nazi-dominated Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  this  cold  December  day,  Watson  was  unyielding.  His  German  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary,  Dehomag,  was  out  of  control.  More  lawyers  would  be  called,  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">telegrams  would  be  sent,  more  clever  maneuvering  with  the  State  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  would  be  undertaken—not  to  stop  Dehomag  from  its  genocidal  part- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nership  with  the  Third  Reich,  but  to  ensure  that  all  the  proceeds  and  profits </p>
<p class="calibre1">remained  with  IBM  NY.  No  matter  who  won,  IBM  would  prosper.  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">was its middle name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2 THE   I B M - H I T L E R    I N T E R S E C T I O N  </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON JANUARY 30, 1933, THE WORLD AWOKE TO A FRIGHTENING </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  reality:  Adolf  Hitler  had  suddenly  become  leader  of  Germany.  Hitlerites </p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed in a spectrum of uniforms from gauche to ominous, paraded, motored, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  bicycled  through  Berlin  in  defiant  celebration.  Hanging  from  trucks  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">stomping through the squares, arms outstretched and often swaggering in song, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Nazis  were  jubilant.  Their  historic  moment—fraught  with  emotional  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pectations  of  revenge  and  victory  against  all  adversaries—their  long </p>
<p class="calibre1">awaited  decisive  moment  had  arrived.  From  this  instant,  the  world </p>
<p class="calibre1">would never be the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  Hitler's  Nazis  moved  to  take  over  the  entire  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  and  virtually  all  aspects  of  German  commerce,  society,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">culture.  Der  Fuhrer  wanted  an  Aryan  Germany  to  dominate  all  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe  with  a  master  race  subjugating  all  non-Aryans.  For  Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  had  a  special  plan:  total  destruction.  There  were  no  secrets  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  vision.  He  broadcast  them  loudly  to  the  world.  They  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ploded  as  front-page  headlines  in  every  major  city,  on  every  radio </p>
<p class="calibre1">network,  and  in  weekly  cinema  newsreels.  Ironically,  Hitler's  fas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cism  resonated  with  certain  men  of  great  vision,  such  as  Henry </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ford.  Another  who  found  Hitlerism  compelling  was  Thomas  J.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son,  president  of  one  of  America's  most  prestigious  companies: </p>
<p class="calibre1">International Business Machines.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  roads  traveled  by  Hitler  and  Watson  began  in  different  parts  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  in  completely  different  circumstances  with  completely  different  inten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  How  did  these  two  men—one  an  extreme  capitalist,  the  other  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme  fascist—form  a  technologic  and  commercial  alliance  that  would  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately  facilitate  the  murder  of  six  million  Jews  and  an  equal  number  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  Europeans?  These  men  and  their  philosophies  could  not  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  dissimilar.  Yet  as  history  proved,  they  could  have  hardly  been  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">compatible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  all  began  decades  before  in  New  York  during  the  last  gasp  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth  century,  at  a  time  when  America's  rapid  industrial  growth  spurred </p>
<p class="calibre1">inventions  to  automate  virtually  every  manual  task.  Swells  of  immigrants </p>
<p class="calibre1">came  to  American  shores  to  labor  long  days.  But  some  dreamed  of  a  better </p>
<p class="calibre1">way  to  be  industrious—or  at  least  a  faster  and  cheaper  way.  Contraptions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanizations,  and  patented  gadgets  were  everywhere  turning  wheels, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cranking  cogs,  and  saving  steps  in  workshops  and  factories.  The  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second Industrial Revolution, powered by electricity, was in full swing. Turn- </p>
<p class="calibre1">of-the-century  America—a  confluence  of  massive  commerce  and  clickety- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clack  industrial  ingenuity—was  a  perfect  moment  for  the  birthplace  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">most powerful corporation the world has ever seen: IBM.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  technology  was  originally  created  for  only  one  reason:  to  count </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  as  they  had  never  been  counted  before,  with  a  magical  ability  to  iden- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tify  and  quantify.  Before  long,  IBM  technology  demonstrated  it  could  do </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  just  count  people  or  things.  It  could  compute,  that  is,  the  technol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ogy  could  record  data,  process  it,  retrieve  it,  analyze  it,  and  automatically </p>
<p class="calibre1">answer  pointed  questions.  Moments  of  mechanized  bustle  could  now  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plish  what  would  be  an  impossibility  of  paper  and  pencil  calculation  for  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">mortal man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herman  Hollerith  invented  IBM.  Born  in  1860,  Hollerith  was  the  son </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  intellectual  German  parents  who  brought  their  proud  and  austere  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">heritage with them when they settled in Buffalo, New York. Herman was only </p>
<p class="calibre1">seven  when  his  father,  a  language  teacher,  died  in  an  accident  while  riding  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">horse.  His  mother  was  left  to  raise  five  children  alone.  Proud  and  indepen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dent,  she  declined  to  ask  her  financially  comfortable  parents  for  assistance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">choosing instead a life of tough, principled self-reliance.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young  Hollerith  moved  to  New  York  City  when,  at  age  fifteen,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">enrolled  in  the  College  of  the  City  of  New  York.  Except  for  spelling  difficul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties,  he  immediately  showed  a  creative  aptitude,  and  at  age  nineteen  gradu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated from the Columbia School of Mines with a degree in engineering, </p>
<p class="calibre1">boasting  perfect  10.0  grades.  In  1879,  Hollerith  accepted  the  invitation  of  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">Columbia  professor  to  become  anassistant  in  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  days,  the  decennial  census  was  l i t t l e   more  than  a  basic  head-count, </p>
<p class="calibre1">devoid  of  information  about  an  individual's  occupation,  education,  or  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">traits  because  the  computational  challenge  of  counting  millions  of  Americans </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  simply  too  prodigious.  As  it  was,  the  manual  counting  and  cross-tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion    process  required  several  years  before  final  results  could  be  tallied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  post-Civil  War  populace  had  grown  so  swiftly,  perhaps  doubling </p>
<p class="calibre1">since the last  census, experts predicted spending more than a decade to </p>
<p class="calibre1">count the 1890 census; in other words, the next census in 1900 would be </p>
<p class="calibre1">underway before the previous one was complete.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  nineteen  years  old,  Hollerith  moved  to  Washington,  D.C.,  to  join </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Census  bureau.  Over  dinner  one  night  at  the  posh  Potomac  Boat  Club, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Director  of  Vital  Statistics,  John  Billings,  quipped  to  Hollerith,  "There  ought </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  a  machine  for  doing  the  purely  mechanical  work  of  tabulating  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion and similar statistics." Inventive Hollerith began to think about a solu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. French looms, simple music boxes, and player pianos used punched </p>
<p class="calibre1">holes  on  rolls  or  cards  to  automate  rote  activity.  About  a  year  later,  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  struck  with  his  idea.  He  saw  a  train  conductor  punch  tickets  in  a  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">pattern  to  record  physical  characteristics  such  as  height,  hair  color,  size  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">nose,  and  clothing—a  sort  of  "punched  photograph."  Other  conductors </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  read  the  code  and  then  catch  anyone  re-using  the  ticket  of  the  original </p>
<p class="calibre1">passenger.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith's  idea  was  a  card  with  standardized  holes,  each  representing  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">different  trait:  gender,  nationality,  occupation,  and  so  forth.  The  card  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  be  fed  into  a  "reader."  By  virtue  of  easily  adjustable  spring  mechanisms </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  brief  electrical  brush  contacts  sensing  for  the  holes,  the  cards  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">"read"  as  they  raced  through  a  mechanical  feeder.  The  processed  cards  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">then be sorted into stacks based on a specified series of punched holes.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millions  of  cards  could  be  sorted  and  resorted.  Any  desired  trait </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  isolated—general  or  specific—by  simply  sorting  and  resorting  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">data-specific  holes.  The  machines  could  render  the  portrait  of  an  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">population—or  could  pick  out  any  group  within  that  population.  Indeed,  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  could  be  identified  from  among  millions  if  enough  holes  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched  into  a  card  and  sorted  enough  times.  Every  punch  card  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  an  informational  storehouse  limited  only  by  the  number  of  holes.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">was nothing less than a nineteenth-century bar code for human beings.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By 1884, a prototype was constructed. After borrowing a few thousand </p>
<p class="calibre1">dollars  from  a  German  friend,  Hollerith  patented  and  built  a  production </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine.  Ironically,  the  initial  test  was  not  a  count  of  the  living,  but  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">dead for local health departments in Maryland, New York, and New Jersey.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,  Hollerith  found  his  system  could  do  more  than  count  people.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  rapidly  perform  the  most  tedious  accounting  functions  for  any  enter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">prise:  from  freight  bills  for  the  New  York  Central  Railroad  to  actuarial  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">financial  records  for  Prudential  Insurance.  Most  importantly,  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">system  not  only  counted,  it  produced  analysis.  The  clanging  contraption </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  calculate  in  a  few  weeks  the  results  that  a  man  previously  spent  years </p>
<p class="calibre1">correlating.  Buoyed  by  success,  Hollerith  organized  a  trip  overseas  to  show </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  electromechanical  tabulator  to  European  governments,  including  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  and  Italy.  Everywhere  Hollerith  was  met  with  acclaim  from  bureau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">crats,  engineers,  and  statisticians.9  His  card  sorter  was  more  than  just  a  clever </p>
<p class="calibre1">gadget.  It  was  a  steel,  spindle,  and  rubber-wheeled  key  to  the  Pandora's  Box </p>
<p class="calibre1">of unlimited information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  sponsored  a  contest  seeking  the  best </p>
<p class="calibre1">automated  counting  device  for  its  1890  census,  it  was  no  surprise  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith's  design  won.  The  judges  had  been  studying  it  for  years.  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly manufactured his first machines.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  1890  census,  Hollerith  became  an  overnight  tabulating  hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  statistical  feat  caught  the  attention  of  the  general  scientific  world  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  the  popular  newspapers.  His  systems  saved  the  Census  Bureau  some  $5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million,  or  about  a  third  of  its  budget.  Computations  were  completed  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">unprecedented  speed  and  added  a  dramatic  new  dimension  to  the  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">nature  of  census  taking.  Now  an  army  of  census  takers  could  posit  235  ques- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions,  including  queries  about  the  languages  spoken  in  the  household,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  children  living  at  home  and  elsewhere,  the  level  of  each  family </p>
<p class="calibre1">member's  schooling,  country  of  origin,  and  scores  of  other  traits.  Suddenly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the government could profile its own population.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  Census  Bureau  only  needed  most  of  the  tabulators  once  every </p>
<p class="calibre1">decade,  and  because  the  defensive  inventor  always  suspected  some  electri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cian  or  mechanic  would  steal  his  design,  Hollerith  decided  that  the  systems </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  leased  by  the  government,  not  purchased.  This  important  decision </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  lease  machines,  not  sell  them,  would  dominate  all  major  IBM  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions  for  the  next  century.  Washington  paid  Hollerith  about  $750,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  rent  his  machines  for  the  project.  Now  the  inventor's  challenge  was  to  find </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers  for  the  machines  in  between  the  decennial  federal  censuses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly, that became no challenge at all. Governments and industry were </p>
<p class="calibre1">queuing  up  for  the  devices.  Census  and  statistical  departments  in  Russia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Italy, England, France, Austria, and Germany all  submitted orders. Hollerith's </p>
<p class="calibre1">new technology was vi r t u a l l y unrivaled. His machines made advanced census </p>
<p class="calibre1">taking  possible  everywhere  in  the  world.  He  and  he  alone  would  control  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  because  the  punchers,  sorters,  and  tabulators  were  all  designed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  compatible  with  each  other—and  with  no  other  machine  that  might </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever be produced.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, millions of punch cards would be needed to capture the </p>
<p class="calibre1">data.  Each  disposable  punch  card  could  essentially  be  used  only  one  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  had  the  underpinnings  of  a  monopoly  and  he  had  not  even  started </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company.  Most  important,  the  whole  enterprise  quickly  elevated  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith  and  his  system  to  supranational  status.13  Governments  were  just  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tomers,  customers  to  be  kept  in  check.  In  many  ways,  Hollerith  felt  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  his  technology  were  indeed  bigger  than  governments.  In  many  ways, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he was right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  world  waiting,  it  was  time  for  the  engineer  to  launch  a  corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ration.  Ironically,  Hollerith  was  too  busy  garnering  new  business  to  create  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">actual  company.  Moreover,  still  in  his  thirties  but  already  set  in  his  ways,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">handlebar  mustachioed  and  often  surly  Hollerith  was  not  well  suited  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  task.  Hollerith  could  dress  in  top  hat  and  elegant  walking  cane  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">occasion  required.  But  he  lacked  patience  and  finesse,  abhorred  the  commer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cialization  such  a  company  required,  and  continually  suspected  his  customers </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  planning  to  steal  his  designs.  Maintaining  a  paternal  connection  to  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">invention,  Hollerith  took  everything  personally.  Hence,  no  client  or  contact </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  too  important  to  antagonize.  Grudges  were  savored  long.  Feuds  relished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  infrequently,  his  attitude  toward  customers  was  take-it-or-leave-it.  Out- </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken  and  abrasive,  he  was  ready  to  do  combat  with  government  officials </p>
<p class="calibre1">whom  he  suspected  of  undermining  his  patent,  here  or  abroad.  The  little </p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyances of life riled him just as much, such as the car that suddenly broke </p>
<p class="calibre1">down, prompting an angry letter-writing campaign to the manufacturer.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  than  his  inventions,  Hollerith  was  said  to  cherish  three  things:  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  heritage,  his  privacy,  and  his  cat  Bismarck.  His  link  to  everything </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  was  obvious  to  all  around  him.  Hollerith  went  out  of  his  way  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">sail  to  Europe  on  German  vessels.  He  once  justified  his  friendship  with  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">colleague's wife, explaining, "[She] is a German so I got along very well with </p>
<p class="calibre1">her."  And  when  colleagues  thought  he  needed  a  rest,  they  suggested  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  a  long  vacation  in  the  one  place  he  could  relax,  his  beloved  ancestral </p>
<p class="calibre1">homeland.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  privacy,  Hollerith  built  a  tall  fence  around  his  home  to  keep  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbors  and  their  pets.  When  too  many  cats  scaled  the  top  to  jump  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">yard,  the  ever-inventive  Hollerith  strung  electrical  wire  along  the  fence,  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nected  it  to  a  battery,  and  then  perched  at  his  window  puffing  on  a  cigar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  a  neighbor  cat  would  appear  threatening  Bismarck's  privacy,  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">would depress a switch, sending an electrical jolt into the animal.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith's  first  major  overseas  census  was  organized  for  the  brutal </p>
<p class="calibre1">regime  of  Czar  Nicholas  II  to  launch  the  first-ever  census  of  an  estimated </p>
<p class="calibre1">120  million  Russians.  Nicholas  was  anxious  to  import  Hollerith  technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the inventor traveled to St. Petersburg to seal the enormous contract.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  after  his  return  from  Russia  in  late  1896,  Hollerith  finally  incor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">porated.  He  located  the  company  office  in  his  austere  two-story  workshop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">warehouse in the Georgetown  section  of Washington,  D.C., just a  few  minutes </p>
<p class="calibre1">drive  from  both  the  White  House  and  Census  Bureau.  He  named  his  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm  with  predictable  plainness:  the  Tabulating  Machine  Company,  a  name </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  would  be  quickly  forgotten.18  But  that  same  entity  would  eventually </p>
<p class="calibre1">become IBM, one of the most recognizable commercial names of all time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SHORTLY  AFTER  the  1900  census,  it  became  apparent  to  the  federal  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  that  it  had  helped  Hollerith's  Tabulating  Machine  Company  achieve  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">global  monopoly,  one  based  on  an  invention  the  Census  Bureau  had—in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">way—"commissioned"  from  an  employee  on  the  Bureau's  own  payroll,  Her- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Hollerith.  Moreover,  the  new  reform-minded  Director  of  the  Census </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bureau,  Simeon  North,  uncovered  numerous  irregularities  in  the  Bureau's </p>
<p class="calibre1">contracts  for  punch  card  machines.  Hollerith  was  gouging  the  federal  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment.  Excessive  royalties,  phantom  machines,  inconsistent  pricing  for  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines  and  punch  cards,  restrictive  use  arrangements—the  gamut  of  vendor </p>
<p class="calibre1">abuses was discovered.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worse,  instead  of  the  Bureau  being  Hollerith's  best-treated  customer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tabulating  Machine  Company  was  charging  other  governments  and  commer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial  clients  less.  North  suspected  that  even  the  Russian  Czar  was  paying  far </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  than  Uncle  Sam.  American  taxpayers,  it  seemed,  were  subsidizing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">newly ascended Hollerith empire.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  he  investigated,  North  was  astonished  to  learn  that  his  predeces- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor,  William  Merriam,  had  negotiated  lucrative  and  sometimes  inexplicable </p>
<p class="calibre1">contracts  with  Hollerith's  firm.  Then,  little  more  than  a  year  after  Merriam </p>
<p class="calibre1">left  the  Census  Bureau,  Hollerith  hired  him  as  president  of  Tabulating </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine Company. A rankled North inaugurated a bureaucratic crusade </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  his  own  agency's  absolute  dependence  on  Hollerith  technology,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the questionable costs. He demanded answers. "All that I desire to be satis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied  of,"  North  asked  of  Hollerith,  "is  that  t h e   [U.S.]  government  is  given  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">fair  and  as  liberal  terms  as  those  embodied  in  the  company's  contracts  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial work and ... for other governments."21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  didn't  like  being  challenged.  Rather  than  assuage  his  single </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  important  customer,  Hollerith  launched  a  tempestuous  feud  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">North,  eastigating  him  before  Congress,  and  even  to  the  man  who  appointed </p>
<p class="calibre1">him,  President  Theodore  Roosevelt.  Tabulating  Machine  Company's  technol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ogy  was  indispensable,  thought  Hollerith.  He  felt  he  could  pressure  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">attack  the  U.S.  government  without  restraint.  But  then  North  fought  back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing  that  Hollerith's  patents  would  expire  in  1906,  and  determined  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">break  the  inventor's  chokehold  on  the  Census  Bureau,  North  experimented </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  another  machine,  and,  finally,  in  July  1905,  he  booted  the  Holleriths  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Census Bureau altogether. Tabulating Machine Company had lost its </p>
<p class="calibre1">client.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  rival  tabulator,  developed  by  another  Census  Bureau  technician </p>
<p class="calibre1">named  James  Powers,  would  be  utilized.  Powers'  machines  were  much  faster </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  Hollerith  devices.  They  enjoyed  several  automated  advances  over  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith.  and  the  units  were  vasdy  less  expensive.  Most  of  all,  Powers'  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  allow  the  Census  Bureau  to  break  the  grip  of  the  Tabulating  Machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">Company.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despondent  and  unapproachable  for  months  during  the  self-inflicted </p>
<p class="calibre1">Census  Bureau  debacle,  Hollerith  refused  to  deal  with  an  onslaught  of  addi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  bad  business  news.  Strategic  investments  porously  lost  money.  Several </p>
<p class="calibre1">key  railroad  clients  defected.  Tabulating  Machine  Company  did,  however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rebound  with  new  designs,  improved  technology,  more  commercial  clients, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  more  foreign  census  contracts.  But  then,  in  1910,  in  an  unbelievably </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrogant  maneuver,  Hollerith  actually  tried  to  stop  the  United  States  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">exercising  its  constitutionally  mandated  duty  to  conduct  the  census.  Claim- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  Census  Bureau  was  about  to  deploy  new  machinery  that  in  some  way </p>
<p class="calibre1">infringed  his  patents,  Hollerith  filed  suit  and  somehow  convinced  a  federal </p>
<p class="calibre1">judge  in  Washington,  D.C.,  to  issue  a  restraining  order  against  the  Thirteenth </p>
<p class="calibre1">Census.  But  the  courts  eventually  ruled  against  Tabulating  Machine  Com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany. Hollerith had lost big.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continuing  in  denial,  the  wealthy  Hollerith  tinkered  with  new  contrap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  and  delved  into  unrelated  diversions  while  his  company  floundered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  doctors  insisted  it  was  time  to  leave  the  business.  Frustrated  stockhold- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers and management of Tabulating Machine Company welcomed that advice </p>
<p class="calibre1">and encouraged Hollerith to retire. Ambivalently, Hol l e r i t h began parceling </p>
<p class="calibre1">out his interests.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  began  with  Germany.  In  1910,  the  inventor  licensed  all  his  patents </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  German  adding  machine  salesman  named  Willy  Heidinger.  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">created  the  firm  Deutsche  Hollerith  Maschinen  Gesellschaft—the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  Machine  Corporation,  or  Dehomag  for  short.  This  firm  was  owned </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  controlled  by  Heidinger;  only  a  few  of  his  relatives  owned  token  shares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  licensee  of  Tabulating  Machine  Company,  Dehomag  simply  leased </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  technology  in  Germany.  Tabulating  Machine  Company  received  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">share  of  Dehomag's  business,  plus  patent  royalties.  Heidinger  was  a  tradi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional  German,  fiercely  proud  of  his  heritage,  and  dedicated  to  his  family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  Hollerith,  Heidinger  was  temperamental,  prone  to  volcanic  outbursts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and always ready for corporate combat.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  year,  a  disillusioned,  embittered  Hollerith  simply  sold  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">completely.  Enter  Charles  Flint,  a  rugged  individualist  who  at  the  edge  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth  century  epitomized  the  affluent  adventurer  capitalist.  One  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first  Americans  to  own  an  automobile  and  fly  an  aeroplane,  an  avid  hunter </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  fisherman,  Flint  made  his  millions  trading  in  international  commodities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons  were  one  of  those  commodities  and  Flint  didn't  care  whom  he  sold </p>
<p class="calibre1">them to.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flint's  war  profiteering  knew  no  limits.  He  organized  a  private  armada </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  help  Brazilian  officials  brutally  suppress  a  revolt  by  that  nation's  navy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thus  restoring  the  government's  authority.  He  licensed  the  manufacture  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  newly  invented  Wright  Brothers  aeroplane  to  Kaiser  Wilhelm  to  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">launch  German  military  aviation  and  its  Great  War  aces.  Indeed,  Flint  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">happily  sell  guns  and  naval  vessels  to  both  sides  of  a  brutal  war.  He  sold  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peru  just  after  leaving  the  employ  of  Chile  when  a  border  skirmish  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  erupted,  and  to  enemies  Japan  and  Russia  during  their  various </p>
<p class="calibre1">conflicts.28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  Flint  it  was  once  written,  "Had  anyone  called  him  a  merchant  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">death,  Flint  would  have  wondered  what  the  fellow  had  in  mind.  Such  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the nature of the Western World prior to the Great War."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flint  had  also  perfected  an  infamous  business  modality,  the  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">trust  Trusts  were  the  anti-competitive  industrial  combinations  that  often </p>
<p class="calibre1">secretly  devoured  competition  and  ultimately  led  to  a  government  crack- </p>
<p class="calibre1">down.  The  famous  Sherman  Anti-Trust  Act  was  created  just  to  combat  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">abuses.  Newspapers  of  the  day  dubbed  Flint,  the  "father  of  trusts."  The  title </p>
<p class="calibre1">made him at once a glamorous legend and a villain in his era.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1911,  the  famous  industrial  combine  maestro,  who  had  so  deftly  cre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  cartel-like  entities  in  the  rubber  and  chemical  lields,  now  tried  some- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  different.  He  approached  key  stockholders  and  management  of  four </p>
<p class="calibre1">completely  unrelated  manufacturing  firms  to  create  one  minor  diversified </p>
<p class="calibre1">conglomerate. The centerpiece would be Hollerith's enterprise.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  four  lackluster  firms  Flint  selected  defied  any  apparent  rationale </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  merger.  International  Time  Recording  Company  manufactured  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">clocks  to  record  worker  hours.  Computing  Scale  Company  sold  simple  retail </p>
<p class="calibre1">scales  with  pricing  charts  attached  as  well  as  a  line  of  meat  and  cheese  slicers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bundy  Manufacturing  produced  small  key-actuated  time  clocks,  but,  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">importantly,  it  owned  prime  real  estate  in  Endicott,  New  York.  Of  the  four, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith's  Tabulating  Machine  Company  was  simply  the  largest  and  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">dominant member of the group.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  agreed  to  the  sale,  offering  his  stock  for  about  $1.21  million, </p>
<p class="calibre1">plus  a  10-year  consulting  contract  at  $20,000  per  year—an  enormous  sum  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  day.  The  resulting  company  was  given  a  prosaic  name  arising  from  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">strange  combination:  Computing-Tabulating-Recording  Company,  or  CTR. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  entity  was  partially  explained  by  some  as  a  synergistic  combine  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  bring  ready  cash  and  an  international  sales  force  to  four  seemingly </p>
<p class="calibre1">viable  companies  stunted  by  limited  growth  potential  or  troubled  economics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather  than  bigness,  Flint  wanted  product  mix  that  would  make  each  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">flagging partners stronger.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  sale  was  finalized,  a  seemingly  detached  Hollerith  strolled </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  to  his  Georgetown  workshop,  jammed  with  stacked  machine  parts  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  corner,  and  declared  to  the  workers  matter-of-facdy:  "Well,  I  sold  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">business."  Approaching  the  men  individually,  Hollerith  offered  one  curt  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  or  another.  He  was  gracious  to  Bill  Barnes,  who  had  lost  an  arm  while </p>
<p class="calibre1">assembling  a  belt  mechanism.  For  Joe,  a  young  shop  worker,  Hollerith  osten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tatiously  handed  him  a  $50  bill,  making  quite  an  impression  on  someone </p>
<p class="calibre1">who had never seen so large a bill.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  withdrew  as  an  active  manager.35  The  commercial  extension </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  his  ingenuity  and  turbulent  persona  was  now  in  the  hands  of  a  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">skilled  supranational  manipulator,  Charles  Flint.  Hollerith  was  willing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  millions,  but  only  on  his  terms.  Flint  wanted  millions—on  any  terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  Flint  wanted  CTR's  helm  to  be  captained  by  a  businessman,  not  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">technocrat.  For  that,  he  chose  one  of  America's  up  and  coming  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">scoundrels, Thomas J. Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CARVED AMONG the densely wooded hills, winding, dusty back roads con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nected  even  the  remotest  farm  to  the  small  villages  and  towns  that  comprised </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Finger  Lakes  region  of  New  York  State  in  the  1890s.  Gray  and  rutted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">crackling  from  burnt  orange  maple  leaves  in  the  fall  and  yielding  short </p>
<p class="calibre1">clouds  of  dust  in  the  summer  beneath  the  hoof  and  wheel  of  Thomas  J.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  bright  yellow  horse-drawn  organ  wagon,  these  lonely  yet  intriguing  by- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ways  seemed  almost  magical.  Pastoral  vistas  of  folding  green  hills  veined </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  streams  lay  beyond  every  bend  and  dip.  But  even  more  alluring  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sheer  adventure  of  selling  that  awaited  Watson.  Back  then,  it  was  just  pianos </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  sewing  machines.36  But  it  took  all-day  tenacity  and  unending  self- </p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence  to  travel  these  dirt  roads  just  for  the  opportunity—not  the  cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tainty, only the opportunity—to make a sale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  "making  the  sale,"  that  calculating  one-on-one  wizardry  that  ends  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  exhilarating  confirmation  of  one's  mind  over  another's  motivation,  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  finesse—the  power—that  came  naturally  to  Watson.  Tall,  lanky, </p>
<p class="calibre1">handsome,  and  intelligent,  he  understood  people.  He  knew  when  to  listen </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  when  to  speak.  He  had  mastered  the  art  of  persuasion  and  possessed  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncanny ability to overcome intense opposition and "close the deal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  born  salesmen  know  that  the  addicting  excitement  of  a  sales  victory </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  short-lived.  No  matter  how  great  the  sale,  it  is  never  enough.  Selling,  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">such people, becomes not an occupation, but a lifestyle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  salesman  can  sell  anything.  Every  salesman  alive  knows  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">words  are  true.  But  they  also  know  that  not  all  salesmen  can  go  further.  Few </p>
<p class="calibre1">of them can conquer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  a  conqueror.  From  simple  merchandise  inauspiciously  sold </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  farmers  and  townsfolk  in  rural  west-central  New  York,  Watson  would  go </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  to  command  a  global  company  consumed  not  with  mere  customers,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  territories,  nations,  and  entire  populations.  He  would  identify  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemies  to  overcome  and  strategies  to  deploy.  Like  any  conqueror,  he  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">vanquish  all  in  his  way,  and  then  demand  the  spoils.  Salesmanship  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  elevate  from  one  man's  personal  elixir  to  a  veritable  cult  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  conquest.  By  virtue  of  his  extraordinary  skills,  Watson  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">delivered  from  his  humble  beginnings  as  a  late-nineteenth-century  horse- </p>
<p class="calibre1">and-buggy  back  road  peddler,  to  corporate  scoundrel,  to  legendary  tycoon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  international  statesman,  and  finally  to  regal  American  icon—all  in  less </p>
<p class="calibre1">than four decades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  born  into  a  clan  of  tough  Scottish  Watsons,  the  future  captain </p>
<p class="calibre1">of industry was actually born Thomas J. "Wasson." His Protestant father, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">brawling, scowling lumberman of little religious tolerance, was so opposed to </p>
<p class="calibre1">h a vi n g  C a t h o l i c   i n -l a w s   in  the  family,  he   changed  his  name  to  Wasson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just to  disassociate.  Eventually, the family  let the  protest  drop  and  re-adopted </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Watson name. Thus, young Tom could be a genuine Watson.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Growing up in the Finger Lakes town of Painted Post offered few choices to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">ambitious,  young  Watson.  To  escape  a  life  of  working  the  family  farm  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">running  horse  teams  pulling  river  barges,  Watson  declared  early  he  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become a teacher. He even obtained his teaching certificate. But after just one </p>
<p class="calibre1">day  on  the  job,  the  impatient  Watson  confessed,  "That  settles  my  teaching </p>
<p class="calibre1">career.  I  can't  go  into  a  schoolroom  with  a  bunch  of  children  at  nine </p>
<p class="calibre1">o'clock in the morning and stay until four."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  wanted  to  dive  into  commerce.  He  began  by  peddling  sewing </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  and  pianos  on  the  road  for  a  store  in  town.  He  had  to  provide  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  horse.  When  his  more  experienced  road  partner  drifted  away,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">took  over—and  did  better.  Even  when  economic  times  hardened,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  to  find  lodging  with  befriended  farmers,  barter  goods,  and  push  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">despite  rain-flooded  roads  and  every  other  adversity.  Despite  his  admirable </p>
<p class="calibre1">results,  Watson's  salary  was  generally  $10  per  week.  Before  long,  he  quit  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">looked elsewhere.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  Watson  learned  that  some  sales  positions  offered  something </p>
<p class="calibre1">called a commission, that is, a cut. He joined a building and loan association in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buffalo  where  he  sold  shares  up  and  down  the  populated  roads  south  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">city.  Watson's  deal  was  straight  commission.  His  manager  was  a  slick  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">dapper  operator  who  taught  Watson  how  to  smoothly  sell  stock  in  saloons, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  how  to  always  dress  the  role  of  a  successful  Gay  Nineties  businessman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing  drives  glibness  like  a  commission-only  job.  Watson  excelled—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the feeling was invigorating. He loved to sell.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1895,  at  age  twenty-one,  Watson  bumped  into  John  J.  Range,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">manager  of  the  Buffalo  office  of  one  of  the  most  rapacious  companies  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">day,  the  National  Cash  Register  Company.  Nicknamed  "The  Cash,"  NCR  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  personal  empire  of  the  ruthless  and  belligerent  tycoon,  John  Patterson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  had  created  a  sales  manual  designed  to  rigidly  standardize  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">pitches  and  practices,  and  even  mold  the  thought  processes  of  selling.  No </p>
<p class="calibre1">deviation  was  allowed.  Patterson's  way  was  the  only  way.  Range  was  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson's  most  successful  sales  supervisors,  brutalizing  and  humiliating  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">underlings  until  they  achieved  their  quotas.  Range  became  a  mentor  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson.  In  no  time,  The  Cash  converted  Watson  into  a  youthful  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercenary.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">W i t h i n   m o n t h s   Watson  was  t h e   territory's  leading  s al e s ma n , </p>
<p class="calibre1">o ut ea r ni n g  Range himself, eventually becoming among the best Cash salesmen </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  the  East  Coast.  His  commissions  reached  as  high  as  $100  per  week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  took  notice,  transferring  Watson  and  his  impressive  skills  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">undesirable  Rochester  office,  one  of  the  worst  performing  of  The  Cash's  160 </p>
<p class="calibre1">branch  offices.  Watson  worked  his  magic  immediately.  On  his  very  first  day, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while tying his horse to the hitching post in front of the National Cash Register </p>
<p class="calibre1">office,  Watson  encountered  the  angry  saloonkeeper  next  door.  The  irate </p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbor  complained  that  The  Cash  enjoyed  a  dismal  reputation  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prior  sales  agent  was  often  too  drunk  to  perform  his  job.  Within  minutes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  somehow  convinced  the  disenchanted  man  to  buy  a  new  cash </p>
<p class="calibre1">register.  Watson  sold  a  second  cash  register  while  riding  out  to  another  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plaining prospect.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  realized  that  Watson  was  good  enough  to  go  beyond  simple </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales.  He  was  good  enough  to  destroy  the  main  competition  in  Rochester,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hallwood  Company,  which  also  marketed  a  cash  register.  Adopting  the  bru- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tal,  anything-goes  techniques  of  Patterson  and  Range,  and  adding  a  few  devi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ous  tricks  of  his  own,  Watson  began  the  systematic  annihilation  of  Hallwood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  sales,  and  its  customer  base.  Tactics  included  lurking  near  the  Hallwood </p>
<p class="calibre1">office  to  spy  on  its  salesmen  and  customers.  Watson  would  report  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">prospective  clients  so  "intimidation  squads"  could  pounce.  The  squads </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  threaten  the  prospect  with  tall  tales  of  patent  infringement  suits  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR  against  Hallwood,  falsely  claiming  such  suits  would  eventually  include </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  who  purchased  Hallwood  machines.  The  frightened  customer  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">then be offered an NCR machine at a discount.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  never  missed  an  opening.  A  Hallwood  salesman  whom  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  befriended  one  day  mentioned  that  he  was  calling  on  a  prospect  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  day.  In  the  morning,  the  Hallwood  salesman  arrived  at  the  merchant's </p>
<p class="calibre1">location  just  as  Watson's  horse  and  buggy  was  riding  off,  the  sale  in  hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  risen  at  dawn  and  driven  twenty  miles  to  steal  the  account.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  enjoyed  the  triumph  so  thoroughly,  he  bragged  about  the  incident  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  to  come.  Within  a few  years,  Watson  had  virtually  driven  Hallwood  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Rochester.  Later,  Watson  bragged  that  he  had  made  Rochester  "one  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">best organized and cleanest territories."44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  liked  Watson's  style.  The  unscrupulous  NCR  president  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  to  use  frivolous  libel  and  patent  suits  to  drive  his  competition  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">submission.  Watson  could  add  a  whole  new  dimension  to  the  war  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  other  than  Patterson  who  dared  buy  or  sell  cash  registers—even </p>
<p class="calibre1">second-hand NCR cash registers. John Patterson believed that cash registers </p>
<p class="calibre1">were his God-granted domain and no one else's. Watson would be the instrument </p>
<p class="calibre1">of his gehemony.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1903,  Watson  was  called  to  Patterson's  office  and  instructed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy  second-hand  dealers  across  the  country.  Although  he  had  become  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">star  in  the  Rochester  office,  Watson  was  still  relatively  unknown  elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson  planted  him  in  New  York  City,  handed  him  a  million-dollar  budget, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  asked  him  to  create  a  fake  business  called  Watson's  Cash  Register  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second  Hand  Exchange.  His  mission  was  to  join  the  community  of  second- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  dealers,  learn  their  business,  set  up  shop  nearby,  dramatically  undersell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly  steal  their  accounts,  intimidate  their  customers,  and  otherwise  disrupt </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  viability.  Watson's  fake  company  never  needed  to  make  a  profit—only </p>
<p class="calibre1">spend money to decimate unsuspecting dealers of used registers. Eventually, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  would  either  be  driven  out  of  business  or  sell  out  to  Watson  with  a  dra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">conian  non-compete  clause.  Funneled  money  from  NCR  was  used  for  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions since Watson had no capital of his own.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mission  was  so  secretive  even  the  NCR  sales  force  in  Manhattan </p>
<p class="calibre1">believed  that  Watson  had  simply  defected  from  the  Rochester  office  to  set  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  own  shop.  He  reported  directly  to  Patterson  and  his  staff.  It  took  years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but the enemy—second-hand dealers—was ruthlessly conquered.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  victim  list  was  long.  Fred  Brainin's  second-hand  business  was  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">14th  Street  in  Manhattan—Watson  bought  him  out  with  a  proviso  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brainin  would  stay  out  of  cash  registers.  Silas  Lacey  of  Philadelphia  merged </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  Watson's  new  front.  The  East  Coast  was  easy.  So  Watson  moved  on  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">real challenge: Chicago.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  biggest  Chicago  dealers  was  Amos  Thomas,  located  on  Ran- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dolph  Street  in  the  Loop,  just  a  few  steps  from  the  Elevated.  Watson's  fake </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  moved  in  across  the  street.  Thomas  remembered,  "Watson  .  .  .  tried </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  get  me  to  put  a  price  on  my  business.  He  wanted  to  control  the  second- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand  business.  I  told  him  I  would  not  sell."  But  Watson  and  his  cohorts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  now  included  his  old  supervisor  John  Range,  would  come  by  three  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">four times each day to press the man.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,  Thomas  would  not  sell.  So  Watson  opened  a  second  competing </p>
<p class="calibre1">store  near  Thomas.  NCR  had  secretly  acquired  control  of  American  Cash </p>
<p class="calibre1">Register  Company,  the  successor  to  Hallwood.  Watson's  second  front,  called </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  Second  Hand  Cash  Register  Company,  only  squeezed  Thomas  fur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther.  Weakened,  Thomas  finally  offered  a  buy-out  price  of  $20,000.  But  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">was just too high for Watson.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  now,  it  was  clear  to  Thomas  that  Watson  was  fronting  for  Patterson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR. The Cash didn't care if Thomas knew or not. To prove it, they invited </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas  to  NCR  headquarters  in  Dayton,  Ohio,  where  he  was  first  treated  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">splendid  dinner  and  then  "handled"  by  a  Patterson  executive.  Unless </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas  sold  out  for  a  "reasonable  price,"  Thomas  was  told,  NCR  would  rent </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet  another  store  near  his  and  continue  to  undersell  until  his  trade  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely  wrecked.  Buckling  under,  Thomas  at  last  agreed  to  sell  for  $15,875 </p>
<p class="calibre1">plus  $500  in  cash.  A  battered  and  broken  Thomas  pleaded  with  Watson,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  owner  of  his  company,  to  be  kind  to  a  long-time  devoted  employee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amos Thomas had been conquered.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson's  school  for  scoundrels  was  unparalleled  in  American  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  history.  A  Watson  aide  once  testified  that  Patterson  would  scream  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">merciless  destruction  of  all  competitors.  "Kill  them!  .  .  .  crush  them,"  Patter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  would  yell  at  sales  conferences.  The  vanquished  included  Cuckoo, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Globe,  Hallwood,  Metropolitan,  Simplex,  Toledo,  Union,  and  scores  of  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">struggling cash register companies.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR  salesmen  wore  dark  suits,  the  corporation  innovated  a  One  Hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dred Point Club for agents who  met their quota, and The Cash stressed "clean </p>
<p class="calibre1">living"  as  a  virtue  for  commercial  success.  One  day  during  a  pep  rally  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">troops,  Watson  scrawled  the  word  THINK  on  a  piece  of  paper.  Patterson  saw </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  note  and  ordered  THINK  signs  distributed  throughout  the  company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  embraced  many  of  Patterson's  regimenting  techniques  as  indispens- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able  doctrine  for  good  sales.  What  he  learned  at  NCR  would  stay  with  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">forever.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR's  war  tactics  were  limidess.  Bribes,  knock-off  machines  at  preda- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tory  prices,  threats  of  litigation,  and  even  smashed  store  windows  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">alleged.  The  federal  government  finally  stepped  in.  On  February  22,  1912, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson,  Watson,  and  several  dozen  other  Cash  executives  were  indicted  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal  conspiracy  to  restrain  trade  and  construct  a  monopoly.  Prosecutors </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  the  conduct  the  most  uncivilized  business  behavior  ever  seen  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">likened Watson and company to "Mexican bandits."54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  year  later,  in  1913,  all  defendants  were  found  guilty  by  an  Ohio  jury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damning  evidence,  supplied  by  Watson  colleagues  and  even  Watson's  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">signed  letters  of  instructions,  were  irrefutable.  Most  of  the  men,  including </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  received  a  one-year  jail  sentence.  Many  of  the  convicted  wept  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  for  leniency.  But  not  Watson.  He  declared  that  he  was  proud  of  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">he had accomplished.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  the  floods.  The  late  winter  and  early  spring  in  Dayton,  Ohio, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  brutal.  Excessive  rainfall  swamped  the  city.  The  Mad  and  Miami </p>
<p class="calibre1">rivers  began  overflowing.  In  late  March  1913,  a  tornado  tore  through  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">area, turning Dayton into a disaster scene, with much of the area under </p>
<p class="calibre1">water. Some 90,000 people suddenly  became homeless. Communications were </p>
<p class="calibre1">cut.  But  Watson  and  others  at  NCR  cont r oll ed  one  of  the  few  telegraph </p>
<p class="calibre1">lines still on high ground.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Cash  pounced.  NCR  organized  an  immense  emergency  relief  effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  company's  assembly  line  was  retrofitted  to  produce  a  flotilla  of  rudimen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary rowboats—one every seven minutes. Botded water and paper cups were </p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed  to  flood  victims  along  with  hay  cots  for  sleeping.  NCR  facilities </p>
<p class="calibre1">were converted into an infirmary. Five babies were born there in one day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  New  York,  Watson  organized  a  relief  train  of  medical  supplies,  food, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  more  water.  Where  roadbed  and  rail  switches  were  washed  away,  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  ordered  them  instandy  repaired.  When  NCR  relief  trains  encountered </p>
<p class="calibre1">irreparable  tracks,  just  a  few  miles  from  Dayton,  Watson  recruited  men  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">carry supplies in on their backs until the goods reached Dayton—all to </p>
<p class="calibre1">cheering crowds.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patterson,  Watson,  and  the  other  NCR  men  became  national  heroes  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">night.  A  press  room  was  established  on  NCR  premises.  Petitions  were  sent  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">President Woodrow Wilson asking for a pardon. Considering public sentiment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">prosecutors offered consent decrees in lieu of jail time. Most of the defendants </p>
<p class="calibre1">eagerly  signed.  Watson,  however,  refused,  maintaining  he  saw  nothing  wrong </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  his  conduct.  Eventually,  Watson's  attorneys  successfully  overturned  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">conviction on a technicality. The government declined to re-prosecute.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  then  the  unpredictable  and  maniacal  Patterson  rewarded  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  as  a  loyal  sales  warrior  by  suddenly  subjecting  him  to  public  humilia- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion in front of a company assembly. Just as Watson was speaking to a festive </p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering  of  Cash  executives,  Patterson  histrionically  interrupted  him  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">praise  another  salesman.  Everyone  recognized  the  signs.  Shortly  thereafter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson was summarily fired.59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  seventeen  years,  NCR  had  been  Watson's  life—the  fast  cars  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  faster  commissions,  the  command  and  control  of  industrial  subterfuge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  sense  of  belonging.  It  was  now  over.  Shocked,  Watson  simply  turned  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">hack  on  his  exciting  lifestyle  at  The  Cash.  "Nearly  everything  I  know  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">building a business comes from Mr. Patterson," Watson would admit. Now he </p>
<p class="calibre1">added  this  vow:  "I  am  going  out  to  build  a  business  bigger  than  John  Patter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son has."60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  bigger  than  National  Cash  Register,  one  of  America's  largest </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations?  Why  stop  at  the  American  shoreline?  Watson  contacted  the  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">man who could take him global, Charles Flint of CTR. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN THOMAS WATSON walked into Charles Flint's Fifth Avenue suite, their </p>
<p class="calibre1">respective  reputations  surrounded  th e m   l i k e   force  fields.  Watson's  was  na- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional.  Flint's  was  international.  Watson  had  manipulated  mere  men.  Flint </p>
<p class="calibre1">had catered to the destiny of nations. Yet, the two did not instandy bond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flint  was  shorter  and  much  older  than  Watson,  although  filled  with  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  much  energy.  After  all,  Flint  had  soared  amongst  the  clouds  in  a  Wright </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brothers  plane  and  driven  automobiles,  sailed  the  fastest  boat  on  many  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">river  or  lake,  and  seen  the  world—all  while  Watson  was  still  traversing  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">roads  on  horseback.  Yet,  during  their  first  meeting, Watson  was  almost  disap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed  in  the  legendary  financier's  presence.  But  it  was  Flint's  ideas  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke louder than his physical stature.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  nineteenth-century  international  economic  adventurer,  Flint  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lieved  that  the  accretion  of  money  was  its  own  nurturing  reward,  and  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  business  world  functioned  much  as  the  animal  kingdom:  survival  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">fittest.  Watson  found  nothing  unacceptable  in  Flint's  philosophy.  Heading  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">CTR  could  be  the  chance  Watson  knew  he  deserved  to  be  his  own  boss  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  all  the  decisions.  CTR's  diverse  line  was  better  than  cash  registers </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  the  dominant  product  was  Hollerith's  tabulator  and  card  sorter.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  men  could  work  together  to  make  CTR  great—that  is,  if  Watson's  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agement deal was structured right.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  from  Flint's  point  of  view,  he  was  hardly  ready  to  stroll  across  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">street  to  CTR's  headquarters  and  install  Watson.  The  supersalesman  before </p>
<p class="calibre1">him  still  walked  under  the  shadow  of  a  criminal  conviction,  which  at  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">point  had  not  yet  been  overturned.  Although  under  appeal,  it  could  cast  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  in  a  bad  light.  During  one  of  several  board  meetings  to  consider </p>
<p class="calibre1">hiring  Watson,  at  least  one  CTR  director  bellowed  at  Flint,  "What  are  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying  to  do?  Ruin  this  business?  Who  is  going  to  run  this  business  while  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">serves his term in jail?"63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  process,  one  that  Watson  was  determined  to  win,  and  so  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke  frankly  to  the  reluctant  directors.  First,  he  sold  himself—like  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">adroit  salesman—and  then  worked  around  their  collective  worries  about  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">conspiracy  conviction.  Visions  of  products  and  profits  proliferating  world- </p>
<p class="calibre1">wide,  million-dollar  growth  projections,  ever-increasing  dividends—these </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  the  rewards  the  directors  embraced  as  most  important.  CTR  bought  in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  offered  "a  gendeman's  salary"  of  $25,000  per  year,  plus  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than 1,200 shares of the firm. But Watson wanted better. He wanted a slice of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  profits.  His  commissionable  days  at  NCR  had  whetted  his  craving  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">more of the same. Much more.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In other words," said Flint, "you want part of the ice you cut." Indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  negotiated  a  commission  of  5  percent  of  all  CTR  after-tax,  after-divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dend  profits.  However,  in  light  of  Watson's  conviction,  he  would  not  join  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm  as  president,  but  rather  as  general  manager.  It  didn't  matter.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  call  the  shots.  May  1,  1914,  was  his  first  day  at  CTR.  Hollerith's  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany,  now  Flint's  company,  would  never  be  the  same.  It  would  soon  become </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's company.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copying  many  of  NCR's  sales  development  and  promotion  techniques, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  built  an  organization  that  even  Patterson  would  have  marveled  at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  Patterson  had  organized  the  One  Hundred  Point  Club  for  salesmen </p>
<p class="calibre1">hitting  their  quota,  Watson  began  a  festive  Hundred  Percent  Club.  Patterson </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  demanded  starched  white  shirts  and  dark  sui t s  at  NCR.  Watson  insisted </p>
<p class="calibre1">CTR  employees  dress  in  an  identical  uniform.  And  Watson  borrowed  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  NCR  innovation,  the  term  THINK,  which  at  CTR  was  impressed  onto </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  many  surfaces  as  could  be  found,  from  the  wall  above  Watson's  desk  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  bottom  of  company  stationery.  These  Patterson  cum  Watson  touches  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">easy  to  implement  since  several  key  Watson  aides  were  old  cronies  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR scandal days.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  understood  much  more  about  human  motivation  than  Pat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terson  had  ever  allowed  to  creep  into  NCR.  Watson  wanted  to  inspire  men  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  results,  not  brutalize  them  toward  mere  quotas.  His  way  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">imbue  a  sense  of  belonging,  not  a  climate  of  fear.  As  a  general  understood </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  troops,  Watson  well  understood  the  value  of  the  workingmen  below  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  executive  men  above.  Moreover,  any  limitation  in  his  general  manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">title  was  soon  overcome.  In  1915,  his  conviction  was  overturned  and  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">forty-eight  hours  the  board  approved  his  ascent  to  the  presidency  of  CTR.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  years,  Watson  worked  quietly  out  of  his  sparse  office  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">CTR,  cementing  the  firm's  financial,  labor,  and  technical  position.  He  did  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">best  to  outmaneuver  and  neutralize  the  competitor  tabulating  machines.  Pat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ent  wars  were  fought,  engineering  campaigns  commenced,  research  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken,  and  major  clients  either  conquered  or  re-conquered.  When  needed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  arranged  bank  loans  to  see  the  company  through  lean  times  and  help </p>
<p class="calibre1">it grow.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith,  although  no  longer  in  control,  remained  as  an  active  consul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tant  with  the  company,  but  found  Watson's  style  completely  alien.  Years </p>
<p class="calibre1">before,  while  still  at  NCR,  Watson  had  ordered  a  Hollerith  machine,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  declined  to  send  one,  fearing  Watson  would  copy  it  for  Patterson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  that  they  were  in  the  same  firm,  the  two  frequently  butted  heads  on  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">range  of  issues,  from  commercialization  to  technical  research.  Unlike  Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith, who was willing to do battle with customers over some barely dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cernible  personal  principle  Watson  wanted  to  win  customers  over  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money. Money was his principle. Flint's chairman, George Fairchild, was also a </p>
<p class="calibre1">towering  force  at  CTR  to  be  reckoned  with.  Watson  navigated  around  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  and  Fairchild.  Without  Flint's  continuous  backing,  Watson  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  have  managed.  Nonetheless,  without  his  unique  winning  style,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">could not have persevered.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  became  more  than  a  good  manager,  more  than  just  an  impres- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sive  executive,  more  than  merely  a  concerned  employer,  he  became  central  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company  itself.  His  ubiquitous  lectures  and  pep  talks  were  delivered  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  uplifting  passion,  they  soon  transcended  to  liturgical  inspiration.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">embodied more than the boss. He was the Leader. He even had a song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clad  in  their  uniforms  of  dark  blue  suits  and  glistening  white  shirts,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">inspirited sales warriors of CTR would sing: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mister Watson is the man we're working for, </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's the Leader of the C-T-R, </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's the fairest, squarest man we know; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincere and true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has shown us how to play the game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And how to make the dough.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  elevating  to  a  higher  plane.  Newspaper  articles  began  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">focus  on him  personally  as  much  as the company.  His  pervasive  presence and </p>
<p class="calibre1">dazzling  capitalistic  imperatives  became  a  virtual  religion  to  CTR  employees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paternalistic  and  authoritarian,  Watson  demanded  absolute  loyalty  and  cease- </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  devotion  from  everyone.  In  exchange,  he  allowed  CTR  to  become  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">extended family to all who obeyed.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1922,  Patterson  died.  Many  have  said  his  death  was  an  emotional </p>
<p class="calibre1">turning  point  for  Watson,  who  felt  his  every  move  was  no  longer  being  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pared  to  the  cruel  and  ruthless  cash  register  magnate.  Some  two  years  later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">CTR  Chairman  Fairchild  also  died.  By  this  time,  Hollerith  had  resigned  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">ennui  from  the  CTR  board  of  directors  and  completely  faded  away  in  poor </p>
<p class="calibre1">health.  Watson  became  the  company's  chief  executive  and  uncontested  reign- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing authority.72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  CTR  would  be  completely  transformed  in  Watson's  image.  A  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">name  was  needed.  In  Watson's  mind,  "CTR"  said  nothing  about  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany.  The  minor  products,  such  as  cheese  slicers  and  key-activated  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">clocks,  had  long  been  abandoned  or  marginalized.  The  company  was  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ducing  vital  business  machines  for  a  world  market.  Someone  had  suggested  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">name for a new company newsletter: International Business Machines.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">International Business Machines - Watson realized that the name de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scribed more than a newsletter. It was th e  personification of what Watson and </p>
<p class="calibre1">his enterprise were all about. He renamed the company. His intensely deter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mined credo was best verbalized by his promise to all: "IBM is more than a </p>
<p class="calibre1">business—it is a great worldwide institution that is going on forever."74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than ever. Watson f u s e d  himself into every facet of IBM's opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions, injecting his style into every decision, and mesmerizing the psyche of </p>
<p class="calibre1">every employee. "IBM Spirit"—this was the term Watson ascribed to the all- </p>
<p class="calibre1">encompassing,  almost  tribal  devotion  to  company  that  he  demanded.  "We </p>
<p class="calibre1">always  refer  to  our  people  as  the  IBM  Family,"  Watson  emphasized  to  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees,  "and  we  mean  the  wives  and  children  as  well  as  the  men."  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">continually spoke in terms of "oneness" with IBM.75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Employees  were  well  treated,  generously  compensated,  entitled  to  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cellent  working  conditions  with  the  most  liberal  benefits  and  vacation  times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">enrolled  in  the  IBM  Country  Club  at  Endicott,  New York,  and  invited to end- </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  picnics,  rallies,  and  dances.  Plus  they  were  inducted  into  the  IBM  Club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  company  just  won't  let  you  get  lonesome,"  assured  one  Club  member. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children  began  their  indoctrination  early,  becoming  eligible  at  age  three  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the kiddy rolls of the IBM Club, graduating to junior ranks at age eight.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look  upon  me  as  the  head  of  the  family,"  Watson  would  preach.  "I </p>
<p class="calibre1">want  you  to  come  to  me  as  often  as  you  feel  that  I  can  do  anything  for  you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feel  free  to  come  and  open  your  hearts  and  make  your  requests,  just  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">same  as  one  would  in  going  to  the  head  of  a  family."  So  penetrating  was  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  father  image  that  employees  routinely  did  ask  his  permission  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary  personal  decisions. John  G.  Phillips, for example,  a  man  so  powerful </p>
<p class="calibre1">within  the  IBM  organization  that  he  ultimately  became  its  vice-chairman,  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  own  an  automobile  until  1926;  in  that  year,  he  finally  approached  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leader.  "Mr.  Watson,"  declared  Phillips,  "I  have  enough  money  to  buy  a  car, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but I would like your permission to do it."77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  own  son,  Tom,  who  inherited  his  father's  throne  at  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">admitted,  "The  more  I  worked  at  IBM,  the  more  I  resented  Dad  for  the  cult- </p>
<p class="calibre1">like atmosphere that surrounded him."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Large  pictures  of  Watson  in  the  weekly  company  publication,  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines,  regularly  sported  headlines  proclaiming  even  his  ordinary  accom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plishments, such as "Thomas J. Watson Opens New Orleans Office." The ever- </p>
<p class="calibre1">present  equating  of  his  name  with  the  word  THINK  was  more  than  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orwellian  exercise,  it  was  a  true-life  indoctrination.  The  Watson  mystique </p>
<p class="calibre1">was never confined to the four walls of IBM. His aura was only magnified by </p>
<p class="calibre1">his autocratic style, barking out orders, demanding everywhere the pinnacle </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  service  and  action  at  a  moment's  notice  employing  a  secretary  to  ostenta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tiously follow him around scribbling notes and instructions on a steno pad.79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newspapers  constantly  reported  his  movements  and  exploits.  It  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">written  during  this  era  that,  "probably  no  businessman  in  the  country  gets </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  name  and  picture  in  the  newspapers  more  often  than  he  does.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">makes  hundreds  of  public  appearances  every  year  at  banquets,  university </p>
<p class="calibre1">commencements,  the  opening  of  art  exhibits  and  similar  occasions."  Fortune </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred  to  Watson  as  "the  Leader,"  with  a  capital  "L."  So  completely  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scious  was  Watson  of  his  mythic  quality  that  he  eyed  even  the  porters  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">trains  and  waiters  in  restaurants  as  potential  legend  busters.  He  tossed  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">big  tips,  often  as  much  as  $10,  which  was  largesse  for  the  day.  As  he  once </p>
<p class="calibre1">explained, "there is a whole class of people in the world who are in a position </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  poor-mouth  you  unless  you  are  sensitive  to  them.  They  are  headwaiters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pullman  car  conductors,  porters  and  chauffeurs.  They  see  you  in  an  intimate </p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion and can really knock off your reputation."80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  giving  liberally  to  charities  and  universities,  by  towering  as  a  patron </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  arts,  by  arranging  scores  of  organizational  memberships,  honorary  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">grees and awards, he further cultivated the man-myth for himself and IBM.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slogans  were  endlessly  drilled  into  the  extended  IBM  Family.  We  For- </p>
<p class="calibre1">give Thoughtful Mistakes. There Is No Such Thing As Standing Still. Pack Up </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your Troubles, Mr. Watson Is Here.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  songs.  They  began  the  very  first  day  a  man  entered  the  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">culture.  They  never  ended  during  one's  entire  tenure.  More  than  100  songs </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  sung  at  various  company  functions.  There  were  several  for  Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including the "IBM Anthem": </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's a thrill in store for all, </p>
<p class="calibre1">For we're about to toast </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corporation that we represent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We're here to cheer each pioneer </p>
<p class="calibre1">And also proudly boast </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of that "man of men," our sterling president. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of T.J. Watson means a courage none can stem: </p>
<p class="calibre1">And we feel honored to be here to toast the IBM.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revival-style  meetings  enthralled  the  men  of  IBM.  Swaying  as  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">chanted  harmonies  of  adulation  for  the  Leader,  their  palms  brought  together </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  fervent  applause  in  hero  worship,  fully  accepting  that  their  families  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">destinies  were  intertwined  with  the  family  and  destiny  of  the  corporation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">legions of company men incessandy re-dedicated themselves to the "Ever </p>
<p class="calibre1">Onward" glory of IBM. All of it swirled around the irresistible magnetism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">t h e   i n t o x i c a t i n g   command,  the  charismatic  cul t i c  control  of  one  man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas J. Watson, the Leader.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">WATSON'S CONNECTIONS to Germany set the stage for a technologic and </p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  alliance  with  the  Third  Reich.  It  began  soon  after  America's  entry </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  Great  War,  when  CTR's  pre-Dehomag  property  in  Germany,  albeit </p>
<p class="calibre1">marginal, was seized by the German government for being owned by an </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy national. As it happened, Watson was delighted with how CTR's assets </p>
<p class="calibre1">were protected during receivership. His feelings were best expressed in a </p>
<p class="calibre1">1937 recollection he penned to Nazi Economics Minister Hjalmar Schaeht.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From  the  day  I  returned  to  Germany  after  the  [Great]  War,"  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  Schacht,  "to  find  my  Company's  affairs  in the  best  safekeeping  by  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alien  Property  Custodian,  well-administered  and  conscientiously  managed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  highly  satisfactory  experience  gained  in  my  association  with  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  industry  after  the  War  while  building  up  my  Company  in  Germany,  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  the  time  of  Germany's  post-War  suffering,  recovery  and  setbacks,  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  felt  a  deep  personal  concern  over  Germany's  fate  and  a  growing  attach- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  to  the  many  Germans  with  whom  I  gained  contact  at  home  and  abroad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  attitude  has  caused  me  to  give  public  utterance  to  my  impressions  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">convictions in favor of Germany at a time when public opinion in my country </p>
<p class="calibre1">and elsewhere was predominantly unfavorable."86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  added,  the  world  must  extend  "a  sympathetic  understanding  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German people and their aims under the leadership of Adolf Hitler."87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  fundamental  sympathy,  Watson  in  1933  possessed  an  extra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary  investment  in  Germany.  It  began  in  the  early  twenties  during  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">height of Germany's tornadic post-War inflation. It was a time when valueless </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  currency  was  transported  from  place  to  place  in  wheelbarrows  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">worth  more  as  kindling  than  as  legal  tender.  In  1922,  Willy  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  a  mere  licensee  of  Hollerith  equipment.  But  the  monetary  cri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sis  in  Germany  made  it  impossible  for  Dehomag  to  pay  royalties  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">monies  it  owed  to  Watson's  CTR,  which  now  controlled  all  of  Hollerith's </p>
<p class="calibre1">patents.  Dehomag's  debt  was  $104,000,  or  the  astronomical  sum  of  450  bil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion marks. There was no way Dehomag could pay it.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  traveled  to  Germany  and  ruthlessly  offered  Heidinger  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">options:  bankruptcy,  or  handing  substantial  ownership  of  Dehomag  over  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson.  It  began  by  Watson  asking  for  only  51  percent  of  the  stock.  But  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's financial position weakened, Watson abruptly upped his demand </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  90  percent  Heidinger  fell  "cornered"  with  no  choice:  he  ceded  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  company  to  Watson,  and  Dehomag  became  a  CTR  subsidiary.  When </p>
<p class="calibre1">CTR  was  renamed  IBM  in  1924,  Dehomag  of  course  continued  as  an  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary.  Heidinger  was  allowed  to  retain  approximately  10  percent  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock.  Dehomag  could  then  still  claim  some  token  German  ownership  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance's sake.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  Heidinger's  shares  were  a  virtual  ruse  because  he  could  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  them  as  long  as  he  worked  for  Dehomag.  Even  then,  he  could  not  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trol  the  stock.  Once  Heidinger  left  the  company,  he  would  have  to  sell  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares  back  to  IBM  and  only  IBM.  Moreover,  Heidinger's  shares  were  used </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  collateral  against  large  deferred  company  loans  and  a  bonus  system.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">all intents and purposes, IBM now controlled the German company.90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  a  decade  after  IBM  acquired  Dehomag,  Watson  tighdy  managed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  subsidiary's  operation,  setting  its  sales  quotas,  and  at  the  same  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">benefiting  from  technical  improvements  to  Hollerith  systems  devised  by  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  engineers.  Eventually,  IBM  began  extending  its  influence  overseas,  cre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ating  subsidiaries  or  agencies  in  dozens  of  countries,  each  with  its  own  name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  Watson's  persona  bigger  than  IBM's  name,  several  of  the  companies </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  namesakes.  Watson  Beige  was  the  Belgian  subsidiary.  Watson  Italiana </p>
<p class="calibre1">was the Italian subsidiary. In Sweden, it was Svenska Watson. In many places, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the business names Watson and IBM were synonymous and inseparable.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  German  subsidiary's  revenues  outshone  them  all.  Many  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean  countries  were  slow  to  adopt  Hollerith  technology.  Germany,  however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  more  willing  to  accept  the  punch  card  systems.  Indeed,  of  some  seventy </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries  and  foreign  branches  worldwide,  more  than  half  of  IBM's  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">seas  income  came  from  Dehomag  alone.  By  1933,  Dehomag  had  turned  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">spectacular  financial  performance,  237  percent  of  its  quota,  and  Willy  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  was  due  to  be  one  of  the  stars  at  the  forthcoming  Hundred  Percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">Club convention in New York.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN  HITLER  came  to  power,  in  January  1933,  he  made  an  open  promise  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">create  a  Master  Race,  dominate  Europe,  and  decimate  European  Jewry.  Num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">berless  racial  laws—local  and  national—appeared  throughout  the  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  could  no  longer  advertise  in  the  phone  book  or  rent  stalls  in  the  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">kets.  Thousands  were  terminated  en  masse  from  their  employment.  Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish-owned companies were forced to fire their Jewish employees.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  paper  pogrom  was  the  dull  edge  of  the  knife.  The  sharp  edge </p>
<p class="calibre1">was violence. Unrestrained acts of depraved Nazi brutality against Jews and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other undesirables began at once, often in fu l l  view of newspapermen and </p>
<p class="calibre1">photographers. Windows were broken. Jews dragged from their homes and </p>
<p class="calibre1">shops were paraded through the streets with humiliating signs hung around </p>
<p class="calibre1">their necks. Some were forced to wash the streets with toothbrushes. Not a </p>
<p class="calibre1">few were kidnapped and tortured by Nazi  gangs. Police looked the other way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  20,  1933,  a  concentration  camp  for  political  enemies  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">established at the pastoral town of Dachau, ten kilometers north of Munich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many others soon followed. Scores of Jewish merchants in Essen and Muen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ster wire delivered wholesale to the infamous camps. In Frankfurt, thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands of frenzied Storm Troopers paraded through the streets chanting, "Kill </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Jews." A London newspaper actually published a Berlin street map locat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing a dozen Nazi torture houses.94 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By April, some 60,000 Jews had been imprisoned and 10,000 more had </p>
<p class="calibre1">fled the country, appearing as refugees throughout Europe and America. Pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fessional  associations were expelling their Jewish members.  Signs were </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoisted in front of hotels, restaurants, beaches, and sometimes even at the edge </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  town:  "Jews  Not  Wanted  Here."  Jews  were  being  swiftly  driven  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">economic and social exclusion as a first step.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newspapers  and  radio  broadcasts  throughout  the  western  countries  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clared  Hitler  a  menace  to  world  peace  and  indeed  world  civilization.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  reacted  with  boycott  and  protest  movements  springing  up  everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Led by the Jews of  New  York and  London,  but supported  by  men and  women </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  conscience  from  all  faiths  and  all  nations,  boycotters  and  protesters  noisily </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  sure  that  no  one  was  unaware  of  the  atrocities  in  Germany.96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  March  27,  some  20,000  protesters  gathered  at  a  monster  Madison </p>
<p class="calibre1">Square  Garden  demonstration  in  New  York  that  was  broadcast  around  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world.  Within  days,  similar  rallies  and  sympathetic  movements  appeared  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris,  Istanbul,  Toronto,  Bombay,  Warsaw,  and  London.  In  Salonika,  70,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greek Jews assembled to launch their anti-Hitler movement.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  in  Bucharest,  Antwerp,  Chicago,  or  Belgrade,  a  growing  world </p>
<p class="calibre1">movement  would  not  stand  by  passively  as  Jews  were  being  targeted.  Anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  boycott  and  protest  actions  erupted  across  the  globe.  The  anti-Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">boycott  systematically  identified  merchants  who  imported  German  goods </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  forced  them  to  stop  by  public  pressure  tactics.  Whether  it  was  small </p>
<p class="calibre1">shops  selling  German  china  and  camera  film,  or  tourists  sailing  across  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Atlantic  on  German  vessels,  outraged  boycotters  demanded  they  switch—or </p>
<p class="calibre1">face a retaliatory boycott.98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor  was  energetic  support  for  the  whole  idea  of  anti-German  boycott </p>
<p class="calibre1">the province of mere agitators. A Depression-wracked world was eager to </p>
<p class="calibre1">replace the Third Reich's economic niche. Commercial interests and labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">unions  everywhere  saw  the  anti-Nazi  movement  as  one  they  could  eagerly </p>
<p class="calibre1">join for both moral and business reasons." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  10,  1933,  more  than  100,000  marchers,  businessmen  and  union- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ists  alike,  Jews  and  Christians,  jammed  midtown  Manhattan.  Newsreel  cam- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eras  mounted  on  platforms  filmed  evocative  scenes  of  anti-German  placards </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  air  amid  a  backdrop  of  furling  American  flags  and  crowds  loudly  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">manded  that  "in  the  name  of  humanity"  all  businesses  stop  doing  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">with Adolf Hitler.100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  question  confronting  all  businessmen  in  1933  was  whether  trading </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Germany  was  worth  either  the  economic  risk  or  moral  descent.  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">question  faced  Watson  at  IBM  as  well.  But  IBM  was  in  a  unique  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">position.  While  Watson  and  IBM  were  famous  on  the  American  business </p>
<p class="calibre1">scene,  the  company's  overseas  operations  were  fundamentally  below  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  radar  screen.  IBM  did  not  import  German  merchandise,  it  merely </p>
<p class="calibre1">exported  American  technology.  The  IBM  name  did  not  even  appear  on  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  thousands  of  index  cards  in  the  address  files  of  leading  New  York  boycott </p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations.  Moreover,  the  power  of  punch  cards  as  an  automation  tool </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  not  yet  been  commonly  identified.  So  the  risk  that  highly  visible  trading </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  provoke  economic  retaliation  seemed  low,  especially  since  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">did not even possess a name suggestive of IBM or Watson.101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  other  hand,  the  anticipated  reward  in  Germany  was  great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  learned  early  on  that  a  government  in  reorganization,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed  a  government  tighdy  monitoring  its  society,  was  good  news  for  IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  Depression  years,  when  the  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  Administration </p>
<p class="calibre1">created  a  massive  bureaucracy  to  assist  the  public  and  control  business,  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">doubled  its  size.  The  National  Recovery  Act  of  1933,  for  example,  meant </p>
<p class="calibre1">"businesses  all  of  a  sudden  had  to  supply  the  federal  government  with  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation  in  huge  and  unprecedented  amounts,"  recalled  an  IBM  official.  Extra </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms,  export  reports,  more  registrations,  more  statistics—IBM  thrived  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">red tape.102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  Germany  offered  Watson  the  opportunity  to  cater  to  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">control,  supervision,  surveillance,  and  regimentation  on  a  plane  never  before </p>
<p class="calibre1">known  in  human  history.  The  fact  that  Hitler  planned  to  extend  his  Reich  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  nations  only  magnified  the  prospective  profits.  In  business  terms,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  account  growth.  The  technology  was  almost  exclusively  IBM's  to  purvey </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  the  firm  controlled  about  90  percent  of  the  world  market  in  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards and sorters.103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for the moral dilemma, it simply did not exist for IBM. Supplying </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Nazis with the technology they  needed was not even debated. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">company whose first overseas census was undertaken for Czar Nicholas II, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the company Hollerith invented in his German image, the company war- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pr of it eeri ng Flint took global, the company built on Thomas J. Watson's cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rugated scruples, this company saw Adolf Hitler as a valuable trading ally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, the Third Reich would open startling statistical venues for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith machines never before instituted—perhaps never before even </p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined. In Hitler's Germany, the statistical and census community, overrun </p>
<p class="calibre1">with doctrinaire Nazis, publicly boasted about the new demographic break- </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughs their equipment would achieve. Everything about the statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks IBM would be undertaking for Germany was bound up in racial poli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tics, Aryan domination, and Jewish identification and persecution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN HITLER rose to power, German intellect descended into madness. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi movement was not merely a throng of hooligans pelting windows and </p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming slogans. Guiding the Brown Shirts and exhorting the masses was an </p>
<p class="calibre1">elite coterie of pseudo-scientists, corrupted professionals, and profit-blinded </p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialists. Nazi jurists, medical doctors, and a clique of scientists—each </p>
<p class="calibre1">with their prestigious academic credentials—found ways to pervert their sci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ence  and  higher  calling  to  advance  the  cause  of  Aryan  domination  and  racial </p>
<p class="calibre1">persecution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  vanguard  of  Hitler's  intellectual  shock  troops  were  the  statisti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cians.  Naturally,  statistical  offices  and  census  departments  were  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  one  clients.  In  their  journals,  Nazi  statistical  experts  boasted  of  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  expected  their  evolving  science  to  deliver.  All  of  their  high  expectations </p>
<p class="calibre1">depended  on  the  continuing  innovation  of  IBM  punch  cards  and  tabulator </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology.  Only  Dehomag  could  design  and  execute  systems  to  identify, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sort, and quantify the population to separate Jews from Aryans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich  Zahn,  president  of  the  Bavarian  Statistical  Office,  phrased  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">best  in  recalling  the  role  of  Nazi  statisticians.  "The  government  of  our  Fuhrer </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Reichschancellor  Adolf  Hitler  is  statistics-friendly,"  wrote  Zahn  in  Allge- </p>
<p class="calibre1">meines Statistisches Archiv (ASA), the official journal of the German Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Society.  Zahn  emphasized  that  Hitler's  "government  not  only  demands  phys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ical  fitness  and  people  strong  in  character  and  discipline,  but  useful  knowl- </p>
<p class="calibre1">edge  as  well.  It  demands  not  only  political  and  economic  soldiers,  but  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific soldiers."104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn  was  a  giant  of  statistics.  Chairman  of  the  German  Statistical  Soci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ety and president from 1931 to 1936 of the International Statistical Institute, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn  was  by  virtue  of  his  prestigious  international  standing  also  an  honorary </p>
<p class="calibre1">member  of  the  American  Statistical  Association.  He  was  also  a  contributing </p>
<p class="calibre1">member  to  the  SS  since  the  first  days  of  the  Hitler  regime.  Zahn  was  among </p>
<p class="calibre1">those chiefly responsible for the immediate ouster of Jews from the German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical Society.105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ASA,  and  technical  journals  like  it,  were  closely  followed  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  since  the  publication  was  a  virtual  roadmap  to  the  desires  of  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistical  hierarchy.  Anyone  active  in  the  statistics  world  read  it.  No  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">office,  even  in  the  United  States,  could  afford  to  overlook  a  subscription. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  the  pages  of  the  ASA  and  similar  statistical  technical  journals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  management  and  engineers  could  review  proven  statistical  method- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ology  that  sought  to  step-by-step  identify  the  Jews  as  undesirables.  In  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">cases,  ASA  articles  were  written  in  conjunction  with  Dehomag  experts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">describing  the  tedious  technical  workings  of  specific  IBM  equipment,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  importandy  how  they  were  applied  or  could  be  applied  to  Reich  policy </p>
<p class="calibre1">and programs.106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  very  onset,  the  scientific  soldiers  of  Hitler's  statistical  shock </p>
<p class="calibre1">troops  openly  published  their  mission  statement.  "Above  all,"  wrote  Prof.  Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johannes  Muller,  in  a  1934  edition  of  ASA,  "remember  that  several  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  problems  are  being  tackled  currendy,  problems  of  an  ideological </p>
<p class="calibre1">nature.  One  of  those  problems  is  race  politics,  and  this  problem  must  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">viewed  in  a  statistical  light."  Muller,  president  of  the  Thuringen  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office,  made  his  comments  in  a  revealing  1934  ASA  article  entided  'The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Position of Statistics in the New Reich."107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">About  the  same  time,  Dr.  Karl  Keller,  writing  in  an  article,  "The  Ques- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  Race  Statistics,"  made  clear  that  Jewish  blood  was  to  be  traced  as  far </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  as  possible.  "If  we  differentiate  in  statistics  between  Aryans  and  Non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aryans, we in essence talk about Jews and non-Jews. In any case, we will not </p>
<p class="calibre1">look  at  religious  affiliation  alone  but  also  ancestry."  Like  other  Nazis,  Keller </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  looking  ahead  to  the  domination  of  all  Europe.  Keller  added,  "beyond </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreeing  on  the  definition  of  race,  we  must  move  toward  agreement  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  races,  at  least  as  far  as  Europe  is  concerned  ...  in  reality,  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">are not a race, but a mix of several races."108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drawing  on  the  emerging  pseudo-academic  notions  of  the  exploding </p>
<p class="calibre1">race  science  field  in  Germany,  Keller  urged  doctors  to  examine  the  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  for  racial  characteristics  and  faithfully  record  the  information.  "However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  every  physician  can  carry  out  these  examinations,"  Keller  cautioned.  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">physician must also undergo special anthropological training.109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The only way to eliminate any mistakes,  Keller insisted, "is the regis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration of the entire population. How is this to be done?" Keller demanded </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the establishment of mandatory personal genetic-biographical forms. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing would hinder us," he assured, "from using these forms to enter any </p>
<p class="calibre1">important information which can be used by race scientists."110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn, in his writings, was explicit in the need to annihilate inferior eth- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nic groups. In his 1937 ASA article entitled "Development of German Popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion Statistics through Genetic-Biological Stock-Taking,"  Zahn specified, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"population politics, based on the principles of racial hygiene, must promote </p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable genetic stock. It must prevent the fertility of inferior life and genetic </p>
<p class="calibre1">degeneration. In other words, this means the targeted selection and promo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of superior life and an eradication of those portions of the population </p>
<p class="calibre1">which are undesirable."111 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other articles, and in keynote speeches for statistical conventions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn stressed, "There is almost no area of life in Germany which has not </p>
<p class="calibre1">been creatively pollinated by the National Socialist ideology. . . This is also </p>
<p class="calibre1">true for the field of statistics. Statistics has become invaluable for the Reich, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Reich has given statistics new tasks in peace and in war."112 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zahn declared, "Small wonder. In its very essence, statistics is very close </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the National Socialist movement." He added, "German statistics has not </p>
<p class="calibre1">only become the registering witness . . . but also the creative co-conspirator </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the great events of time."113 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, as co-conspirators, Nazi statisticians worked hand-in-hand with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the battalions of Hitler's policy enablers and enforcers, from the Nazi Party's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Race Political Office and all its many allied agencies to the SS itself. Identify- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing the Jews was only the first step along the road to Jewish destruction in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.114 </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  the  publicly  voiced  statements  of  Hitler's  scientific  soldiers </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever  dissuaded  Dehomag  or  IBM  NY  from  withdrawing  from  their  collabora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  with  the  Reich.  By  necessity,  that  collaboration  was  intense,  indispens- </p>
<p class="calibre1">able.  and  continuous.  Indeed,  the  IBM  method  was  to  first  anticipate  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs  of  government  agencies  and  only  then  design  proprietary  data  solu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions,  train  official  staff,  and  even  implement  the  programs  as  a  sub-contrac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tor when called upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  machines  were  useless  in  crates.  Tabulators  and  punch  cards  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  delivered  ready  to  use  like  typewriters,  adding  machines,  or  even  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chine  guns.  Each  Hollerith  system  had  to  be  custom-designed  by  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers. Systems to inventory spare aircraft parts for the Luftwaffe, track </p>
<p class="calibre1">railroad  schedules  for  Reichsbahn  and  register  the  Jews  within  the  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  for  the  Reich  Statistical  Office  were  each  designed  by  Dehomag  engi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">neers to be completely different from each other.115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  course  the  holes  could  not  be  punched  just  anywhere.  Each  card </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  to  be  custom-designed  with  data  fields  and  columns  precisely  desig- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated  for  the  card  readers.  Reich  employees  had  to  be  trained  to  use  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards.  Dehomag  needed  to  understand  the  most  intimate  details  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">intended use, design the cards, and then create the codes.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  of  the  almost  limitless  need  for  tabulators  in  Hitler's  race  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">geopolitical  wars,  IBM  NY  reacted  enthusiastically  to  the  prospects  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazism.  While  other  fearful  or  reviled  American  businessmen  were  curtailing </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  canceling  their  dealings  in  Germany,  Watson  embarked  upon  an  historic </p>
<p class="calibre1">expansion  of  Dehomag.  Just  weeks  after  Hitler  came  to  power,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">invested  more  than  7  million  Reichsmarks—in  excess  of  a  million  dollars— </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  dramatically  expand  the  German  subsidiary's  ability  to  manufacture </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.117 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  be  sure,  Dehomag  managers  were  as  fervently  devoted  to  the  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">movement  as any  of  Hitler's  scientific  soldiers.  IBM  NY  understood this  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  outset.  Heidinger,  a  rabid  Nazi,  saw  Dehomag's  unique  ability  to  imbue </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Reich  with  population  information  as  a  virtual  calling  from  God.  His </p>
<p class="calibre1">enraptured  passion  for  Dehomag's  sudden  new  role  was  typically  expressed </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  opening  a  new  IBM  facility  in  Berlin.  "I  feel  it  almost  a  sacred  action," </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared  Heidinger  emotionally,  "I  pray  the  blessing  of  heaven  may  rest </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon this place."118 </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  day,  while  standing  next  to  the  personal  representative  of  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  IBM,  with  numerous  Nazi  Party  officials  in  attendance,  Heidinger  pub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">licly  announced  how  in  tune  he  and  Dehomag  were  with  the  Nazi  race  scien- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tists  who  saw  population  statistics  as  the  key  to  eradicating  the  unhealthy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inferior segments of society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  physician  examines  the  human  body  and  determines  whether  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  organs  are  working  to  the  benefit  of  the  entire  organism,"  asserted  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger  to  a  crowd  of  Nazi  officials.  "We  [Dehomag]  are  very  much  like  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">physician,  in  that  we  dissect,  cell  by  cell,  the  German  cultural  body.  We </p>
<p class="calibre1">report  every  individual  characteristic  . . .   on  a  little  card.  These  are  not  dead </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,  quite  to  the  contrary,  they  prove  later  on  that  they  come  to  life  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  cards  are  sorted  at  a  rate  of  25,000  per  hour  according  to  certain  charac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teristics.  These  characteristics  are  grouped  like  the  organs  of  our  cultural </p>
<p class="calibre1">body,  and  they  will  be  calculated  and  determined  with  the  help  of  our  tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lating machine.119 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We are proud that we may assist in such task, a task that provides our </p>
<p class="calibre1">nation's Physician [Adolf Hitler] with the material he needs for his examina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">t i o n s .   O u r   P h ys i c i a n  can then determine whether the calculated values are </p>
<p class="calibre1">in harmony with the health of our people. It also means that if such is not the </p>
<p class="calibre1">case, our Physician can take corrective procedures to correct the sick circum- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stances... Our characteristics are deeply rooted in our race. Therefore, we </p>
<p class="calibre1">must cherish them like a holy shrine which we will—and must—keep pure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have the deepest trust in our Physician and will follow his instructions in </p>
<p class="calibre1">blind faith, because we know that he will lead our people to a great future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hail to our German people and der Fuhrer!"120 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of Heidinger's speech, along with a list of the invited Nazi Party </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials, was rushed to Manhattan and immediately translated for Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The IBM Leader cabled Heidinger a prompt note of congratulations for a </p>
<p class="calibre1">job well done and sentiments well expressed.121 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was right about this time that Watson decided to engrave the five </p>
<p class="calibre1">steps leading up to the door of the IBM School in Endicott, New York, with </p>
<p class="calibre1">five of his favorite words. This school was the place where Watson would </p>
<p class="calibre1">train his valued disciples in the art of sales, engineering, and technical sup- </p>
<p class="calibre1">port. Those five uppermost steps, steps that each man ascended before enter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing the front door, were engraved with the following words: </p>
<p class="calibre1">READ </p>
<p class="calibre1">LISTEN </p>
<p class="calibre1">DISCUSS </p>
<p class="calibre1">OBSERVE </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fifth and uppermost step was chiseled with the heralded theme of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the company. It said THINK.122 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The word THINK was everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3 IDENTIFYING  THE  JEWS </p>
<p class="calibre1">THEY WERE  SINGING TO THEIR LEADER. Arms locked, swaying in song, </p>
<p class="calibre1">male voices rising in adulation and expectation, they crooned their praises with </p>
<p class="calibre1">worshipful  enthusiasm.  Clicking  beer  steins  in  self-congratulation,  reassured </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  their  vision  of  things  to  come,  Storm  Troopers  everywhere  sang </p>
<p class="calibre1">the "Horst Wessel Song"as a Nazi testament and a prophecy both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the final </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bugle call to arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already we are set </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prepared to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon Hitler's flags will wave </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over every single street </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enslavement ends </p>
<p class="calibre1">When soon we set things right! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  in  beer  halls,  sports  fields,  or  just  swaggering  down </p>

<p class="calibre1">Third </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">joyously </p>
<p class="calibre1">chanted  their  most  popular  anthem.  With  good  reason.  For  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sturm  Abteilung  (SA),  or  Storm  Troopers,  the  ascent  of  Adolf  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  deliverance  from  the  destitution  and  disconsolation  of  lives </p>
<p class="calibre1">long </p>
<p class="calibre1">disenfranchised </p>
<p class="calibre1">by </p>
<p class="calibre1">personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstance </p>
<p class="calibre1">or </p>
<p class="calibre1">character. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But </p>
<p class="calibre1">they needed a scapegoat. They blamed the Jews—for everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews had conspired to create the Depression, to enslave the German race, to </p>
<p class="calibre1">control society, and to pollute Aryan blood. And now the followers of Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">would exact their bizarre brand of justice and revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More precisely, the Nazis planned to uproot the alien Jews from their </p>
<p class="calibre1">prized  positions  within  German  commerce  and  culture.  The  angry  young  men </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the SA, many of them dregs within German society, believed they would </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon step into all the economic and professional positions held by their Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish neighbors. Through unending racial statutes ousting Jews from profes- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sional and commercial life, relentless purges and persecution, unyielding </p>
<p class="calibre1">programs of asset confiscation, systematic imprisonment and outright expul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion, the SA would usurp the Jewish niche. Nazis would assume Jewish jobs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">expropriate Jewish companies, seize Jewish property, and in all other ways </p>
<p class="calibre1">banish  Jews  from  every  visible  facet  of  society.  Once  the  Nazis  finished  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jews  of  Germany,  they  would  extend  their  race  war  first  to  the  Greater </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich in Europe they envisioned, and ultimately to the entire Continent.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Jewish  life  could  only  be  extinguished  if  the  Nazis  could  identify </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jews.  Just  which  of  Germany's  60  million  citizens  were  Jewish?  And  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  was  the  definition  of  "Jewish"?  Germans  Jews  were  among  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">assimilated of any in Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  mythology  accused  Jews  of  being  an  alien  factor  in  German  soci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ety. But in truth, Jews had lived in Germany since the fourth century. As else- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  in  Europe  during  the  Middle  Ages,  what  German  Jews  could  do  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">say, even their physical dress, was oppressively regulated. Waves of persecu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  were  frequent.  Worse,  anti-Jewish  mobs  often  organized  hangings  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">immolation  at  the  stake.  Even  when  left  alone,  German  Jews  could  exist  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">in segregated ghettos subject to a long list of prohibitions.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pressure  to  escape  Germany's  medieval  persecution  created  a  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  kind  of  European  Jew,  one  who  subordinated  his  Jewish  identity  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  larger  Christian  society  around  him.  Assimilation became  a  desirable  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dote,  especially  among  Jewish  intellectuals  during  the  Age  of  Enlightenment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Napoleon conquered part of Germany in the early nineteenth century, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  granted  Jews  emancipation.  But  after  Napoleon  was  defeated,  the  harsh </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  status  quo  ante  was  restored.  The  taste  of  freedom,  however,  led </p>
<p class="calibre1">affluent  and  intellectual  Jewish  classes  to  assimilate  en  masse.  Philosophi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cally,  assimilationists  no  longer  considered  themselves  Jews  living  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  Instead,  they  saw  themselves  as  Germans  who,  by  accident  of  birth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were of Jewish ancestry.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  succumbed  to  the  German  pressure  to  convert  to  Christianity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">German Jewry lost to apostasy many of its best commercial, political, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">intellectual leaders. A far greater number were convinced that Jewish ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">identity should be denied, but  nonetheless saw quintessential value in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">tenets  of  Moses.  These  German  Jews  developed  a  religious  movement  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  the  forerunner  of  Reform  Judaism.  Yet,  even  many  of  this  group  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately converted to Christianity.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between  1869  and  1871,  Germany  granted  Jews  emancipation  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">many,  but not all, civic, commercial, and political restrictions.  Germany's Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">seized  the  chance  to  become  equals.  They  changed  their  surnames,  adopted </p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  religious  laxity  through  Reform  Judaism,  and  frequently  married </p>
<p class="calibre1">non-Jews,  raising  their  children  as  Christians.  Outright  conversion  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">common. Many of Jewish ancestry did not even know it—or care.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  of  approximately  550,000  Jews  in  Germany  who  were  emanci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pated  in  1871,  roughly  60,000  were  by  1930  either  apostates,  children  raised </p>
<p class="calibre1">without  Jewish  identity  by  a  mixed  marriage,  or  Jews  who  had  simply  drifted </p>
<p class="calibre1">away.  Even  those  consciously  remaining  within  organized  Jewish  "communi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties"  neglected  their  remnant  Jewish  identity.  The  Jews  of  twentieth-century </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  like  their  Christian  neighbors,  embraced  national  identity  far  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  religious  identity.  In  the  minds  of  German  Jews,  they  were  "101  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent" German, first and foremost.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  Reich  believed  otherwise.  The  Jewish  nemesis  was  not  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  practice,  but  of  bloodline.  Nazis  were  determined  to  somehow </p>
<p class="calibre1">identify those of Jewish descent, and destroy them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IDENTIFYING  THE  Jews  in  Germany  would  be  an  uphill  technologic  chal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lenge  that  would  take  years  of  increasingly  honed  counting  programs  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">registration  campaigns.  From  the  moment  Hitler  was  appointed  Chancellor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fear  gripped  the  entire  Jewish  community.  No  Jew  wanted  to  step  forward </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  identify  himself  as  Jewish,  and  therefore  become  targeted  for  persecu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  Many  doubted  they  even  possessed  enough  Jewish  parentage  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">included  in  the  despised  group.  Indeed,  not  a  few  frightened  Jews  tried  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">join  the  denunciations  of  the  Jewish  community  to  emphasize  their  loyal </p>
<p class="calibre1">German national character.7 But that did not help them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  identification  process  began  in  the  first  weeks  of  the  Third  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  April  12,  1933,  when  the  Hitler  regime  announced  that  a  long  delayed </p>
<p class="calibre1">census  of  all  Germans  would  take  place  immediately.  Friedrich  Burgdorfer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">director  of  the  Reich  Statistical  Office,  expressed  the  agency's  official  grati- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tude  that  the  "government  of  our  national  uprising  had  ordered  the  census." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burgdorfer, a virulent Nazi, also headed up the Nazi Party's Race Political </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office and became a  leading  figure in the German Society for Racial </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hygiene.  He  was  jubilant  because  he  understood  that  Germany  could  not  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">cleansed of Jews until it i de n t i f i e d  them—however long that would take.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Nazis  wanted  fast  answers  about  their  society  and  who  among </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  was  Jewish.  Censuses  in  Germany  had  long  asked  typical  and  innocent </p>
<p class="calibre1">questions of religious affiliation. But since the Great War, European popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion shifts and dislocations had brought many more Jews to Germany, espe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cially  from  Poland.  No  one  knew  how  many,  where  they  lived,  or  what  jobs </p>
<p class="calibre1">they held. Most of all, no one knew their names. The Nazis knew prior cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">suses  were  plagued  by  three  to  five  years  of  hand  sorting,  rendering  the  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sulty virtually useless for enacting swift social policies. If only the Nazis could </p>
<p class="calibre1">at least obtain information on the 41 million Germans living in Prussia, Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's largest state, comprising three-fifths of the German populace. How </p>
<p class="calibre1">fast?  Nazi  planners  wanted  all  41  million  Prussians  processed  and  prelimi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nary  results  produced  within  a  record  four  months.  The  Prussian  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself was completely incapable of launching such a massive undertaking.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  IBM's  Dehomag  was.  The  company  offered  a  solution:  it  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">handle  almost  the  entire  project  as  a  contract.  Dehomag  would  design  a  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  package  counting  and  classifying  every  citizen.  Moreover,  it  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">recruit, train, and even feed the hundreds of temporary workers needed to </p>
<p class="calibre1">process  the  census  and  perform  the  work  on  Dehomag's  own  premises.  If  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">government would gather the information, Dehomag would handle every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  else.  To  secure  the  deal,  Dehomag  turned  to  its  special  consultant  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">governmental contracts, attorney Karl Koch.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Koch  enjoyed  good  Nazi  Party  as  well  as  government  connections.  With </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  help,  Koch  had  recently  traveled  to  IBM  offices  in  New  York  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">learn  more  about  the  company's  technical  capabilities  and  pick  up  tips  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiating  tough  government  contracts.  By  late  May  1933,  Koch  was  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">joyously  report  to  Watson  that  he  had  secured  a  RM  1.35  million  contract  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct  the  Prussian  census.  This  was  a  test  case  for  Dehomag's  relationship </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  Nazi  Reich.  "We  now  have  a  chance  to  demonstrate  what  we  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">capable to do," Koch wrote to Watson.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Koch  was  careful  to  credit  his  recent  training  in  the  United  States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Equipped  with  increased  knowledge,"  Koch  wrote  Watson,  "and  strength- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ened  by  the  experience  collected  during  my  highly  inspiring  trip  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">States,  I  was  able  to  conduct  the  lengthy  negotiations  and  to  accomplish  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult work."12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  wrote  back  a  letter  of  appreciation  to  Koch  and  hoped  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">would "have the pleasure of visiting your country next year."13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Organizing  the  census  was  a  prodigious  task.  Dehomag  hired  some  900 </p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary  staffers,  mainly  supplied  by  the  Berlin  employment  office,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  become  dominated  by  the  venomous  German  Labor  Front.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed  good  relations  with  the  German  Labor  Front,  which  ranked  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">vanguard  of  radical  Nazism.  Coordinating  with  the  Berlin  employment  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">christened  the  enterprise  as  a  patriotic  duty,  since  relieving  joblessness  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">major  buzzword  objective  of  Hitler's  promise  to  Germany.  Dehomag's  two- </p>
<p class="calibre1">week  immersion  data  processing  courses  instructed  seventy  to  seventy-five </p>
<p class="calibre1">people at a time in daily four-hour sessions.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical  battalions  were  emerging.  The  Berlin  employment  office  allo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cated large, well-lit halls for their training. Looking from the rear of the train- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  hall,  one  saw  a  sea  of  backs,  each  a  matronly  dressed  woman  sporting  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">no-nonsense  bun  hairdo,  tilted  over  census  forms  and  punching  machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Packed  along  rows  of  wooden  study  benches,  even  behind  view-blocking  pil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lars,  trainees  diligently  took  notes  on  small  pads  and  scrutinized  their  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sized  census  forms.  Methodically,  they  learned  to  extract  and  record  the  vital </p>
<p class="calibre1">personal  details.  Large  "Smoking  Prohibited"  signs  pasted  above  the  front </p>
<p class="calibre1">wall  reinforced  the  regimented  nature  of  the  setting.  At  the  front,  next  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">blackboard,  an  instructor  wearing  a  white  lab  coat  explained  the  complicated </p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks  of  accurately  punching  in  data  from  handwritten  census  questionnaires, </p>
<p class="calibre1">operating  the  sorting,  tabulating,  and  verifying  machines,  and  other  data  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cessing chores.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  June  16,  1933,  one-half  million  census  takers,  recruited  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">ranks  of  the  "nationalistically  minded,"  went  door-to-door  gathering  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation.  Cadres  of  Storm  Troopers  and  SS  officers  were  added to  create a  vir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tual  census  army.  In  some  localities,  when  recruitment  flagged,  individuals </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  coerced  into  service.  The  interviews  included  pointed  questions  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  head  of  the  household's  religion  and  whether  the  person  was  in  a  mixed </p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  essence,  the  amount  of  data  that  could  be  stored  on  a  card  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">function  of  the  number  of  holes  and  columns.  A  spectrum  of  data  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">extracted  by  simply  recording  different  combinations  of  hole  punches.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  reason,  Dehomag  abandoned  its  standard  45-column  cards  and  moved </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  60-column  format.  Sixty  columns,  each  with  ten  horizontal  positions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">created  600  punch  hole  possibilities  per  card.  Each  column,  depending  upon </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  it  was  punched,  represented  a  biographical  characteristic.  These  600 </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  holes,  arrayed  in  their  endless  combinations,  yielded  thousands  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">demographic  permutations.  Even  still,  Dehomag  officials  wondered  whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">all the data the Reich needed could be accommodated on the 60-column </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  they  were  using.  Dehomag  declared  in  a  company  newsletter  that  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  willing  to  move  to  an  80-column  format  tor  the  census,  if  required  "for </p>
<p class="calibre1">political  reasons."17  Soon  the  Reich  could  begin  the  identification  process— </p>
<p class="calibre1">who was Aryan and who was a Jew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Population  statistics  had  crossed  the  fiery  border  from  a  science  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymous masses to the investigation of individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN  MID-SEPTEMBER,  1933,  6,000  brown  cardboard  boxes  began  unceremo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">niously arriving at the cavernous Alexanderplatz census complex in Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each  box  was  stuffed  with  questionnaires  manually  filled  out  by  pen  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">pencil, but soon to be processed by an unprecedented automated praxis. As </p>
<p class="calibre1">supervisors  emptied  their  precious  cargo  at  the  Prussian  Statistical  Office, </p>
<p class="calibre1">each questionnaire—one per household—was initialed by an intake clerk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stacked, and then transferred downstairs. "Downstairs" led to Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">massive  22,000-square-foot  hall,  just  one  floor  below,  specifically  rented  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the project.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Messengers  shuttling  stacks  of  questionnaires  from  the  Statistical  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Dehomag bounded down the right-hand side of an enclosed stairwell. As </p>
<p class="calibre1">they descended the short flight, the sound of clicking became louder and </p>
<p class="calibre1">louder. At the landing, they turned left and pushed through the doors. As the </p>
<p class="calibre1">doors  swung  open,  they  encountered  an  immense  high-ceilinged,  hangar-like </p>
<p class="calibre1">facility  reverberating  with  the  metallic  music  of  Hollerith  technology.  Some </p>
<p class="calibre1">450  data  punchers  deployed  in  narrow  rows  of  punching  stations  labored </p>
<p class="calibre1">behind  tall  upright  secretarial  displays  perfectly  matched  to  the  oversized </p>
<p class="calibre1">census questionnaires.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning left again, and then another right brought the messengers to a </p>
<p class="calibre1">long windowed wall lined with narrow tables. The forms were piled there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From these first tables, the forms were methodically distributed to central- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ized desks scattered throughout the work areas. The census forms were then </p>
<p class="calibre1">loaded onto small trolleys and shutded again, this time to individual work </p>
<p class="calibre1">stations, each equipped with a device that resembled a disjointed typewriter </p>
<p class="calibre1">- actually an input engine.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A continuous "Speed Punching" operation ran two shifts, and three </p>
<p class="calibre1">when needed. Each shift spanned 7.5 hours with 60 minutes allotted for </p>
<p class="calibre1">"fresh air breaks" and a company-provided meal. Day and night, Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">staffers entered the details on 41 million Prussians at a rate of 150 cards per </p>
<p class="calibre1">hour. Allowing for holidays and a statistical prediction of absenteeism, yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever obsessed with its four-month deadline, Dehomag decreed a quota of </p>
<p class="calibre1">450,000  cards  per  day  for  its  workforce.  Free  coffee  was  provided  to  keep </p>
<p class="calibre1">people  awake.  A  gymnast  was  brought  in  to  demonstrate  graceful  aerobics </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  techniques  to  relieve  fatigue.  Company  officials  bragged  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">41  million  processed  cards,  if  stacked,  would  tower  two  and  a  half  times </p>
<p class="calibre1">higher  than  the  Zugspitze,  Germany's  10,000-foot  mountain  peak.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">intended to reach the summit on time.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  company  officials  looked  down  upon  a  floor  plan  of  the  layout,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">linear  rows  and  intersecting  columns  of  work  stations  must  have  surely </p>
<p class="calibre1">resembled  a  grandiose  punch  card  itself  animated  into  a  three-dimensional </p>
<p class="calibre1">bricks  and  mortar  reality.  Indeed,  a  company  poster  produced  for  the  project </p>
<p class="calibre1">showed  throngs  of  miniscule  people  scrambling  over  a  punch  card  sketch.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The surreal artwork was more than symbolic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  punched,  the  columns  were  imbued  with  personal  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  individual:  county,  community,  gender,  age,  religion,  mother </p>
<p class="calibre1">tongue, number of children, current occupation, and second job, if any.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be  Aware!"  reminded  huge  block-lettered  signs  facing  each  cluster  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">data  entry  clerks.  Instructions  were  made  clear  and  simple.  Column  22  RELI- </p>
<p class="calibre1">GION was to be punched at hole 1 for Protestant, hole 2 for Catholic, or hole 3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Jew.  Columns  23  and  24  NATIONALITY  were  to  be  coded  in  row  10  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish speakers.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  punching,  the  cards  were  shuttled  to  a  separate  section  of  the  hall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  they  passed  through  long,  squat  Hollerith  counters  at  the  rate  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">24,000  per  hour. The  system  kept  track  of  its  own  progress.  Hence,  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  always  aware  whether  it  was  on  schedule.  Once  counted,  the  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">moved  to  the  proofing  section.  No  errors  would  be  tolerated  and  speed  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">essential.  Proofing  machines  tabulated  and  verified  proper  punching  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">more than 15,000 cards per hour.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Jews  were  discovered  within  the  population,  a  special  "Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">counting  card"  recorded  the  place  of  birth.  These  Jewish  counting  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were processed separately.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  the  awesome  sorting  and  resorting  process  for  twenty-five </p>
<p class="calibre1">categories  of  information  cross-indexed  and  filtered  through  as  many  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-five  separate  operations—by  profession,  by  residence,  by  national  ori- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gin,  and  a  myriad  of  other  traits.  It  was  all  to  be  correlated  with  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  land  registers,  community  lists,  and  church  authorities  to  create  a  fan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tastic  new  database.  What  emerged  was  a  profession-by-profession,  city-by- </p>
<p class="calibre1">city, and indeed a block-by-block revelation of the Jewish presence.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  Reich  Statistical  Office  summary  reported:  "The  largest  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jews [in Berlin] will be found in the Wilmersdorf district. Approximately </p>
<p class="calibre1">26,000 Observant Jews account for 13.54 percent of the population within </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  district."  Further:  a  total  of  1,200  "Fur-Jews"  accounted  for  5.28  percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  furrier  trade,  and  nearly  three-fourths  of  those  are  foreign-born.  Fur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ther:  based  on  existing  emigration  trends  triggered  by  anti-Jewish  persecu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  "only  415,000  to  425,000  Faith-Jews  would  remain  in  the  German  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">by the middle of 1936."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  precious  information  would  now  help  propel  a  burgeoning </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  binary of pseudo-science and official race hatred. Racial hygiene, race </p>
<p class="calibre1">politics,  and  a  constellation  of  related  anti-Semitic  disciplines  were  just  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  talk  in  the  absence  of  genuine  statistics.  Now  a  lightning  storm  of  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  legislation  and  decrees  restricting  Jews  from  all  phases  of  academic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">professional,  governmental,  and  commercial  life  would  be  empowered  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  abil i t y   to  target  the Jews  by  individual  name.  Moreover,  by  cross-sorting </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jews  revealed  in  Column  22  row  3  with  Polish  speakers  identified  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Columns  26  and  27  row  10,  the  Reich  was  able  to  identify  who  among  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  would  be  its  first  targets  for  confiscation,  arrest,  imprisonment,  and  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately  expulsion.  The  so-called  Ostjuden,  or  Eastern  Jews,  primarily  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">go.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich  Zahn,  publisher  of  Allgemeines  Statistisches  Archiv,  summed  up </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  glee  when  he  wrote,  "In  using  statistics,  the  government  now  has  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">road map to switch from knowledge to deeds."30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">DEHOMAG'S  CENSUS  undertaking  was  an  unparalleled  accomplishment  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM.  Watson  was  impressed  from  the  moment  Karl  Koch  secured  the  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tract. Clearly, there was a lucrative future for IBM in Nazi Germany. At a time </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  other  foreign  companies  were  fleeing  the  Reich's  violence,  repression, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-Semitism,  and  the  inability  to  retrieve  income  from  German  operations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson moved swiftly to dramatically enlarge IBM's presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  he  ordered  the  merger  of  several  small  IBM  subsidiaries  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  Optima,  Degemag,  Holgemag,  as  well  as  the  existing  Dehomag,  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">folded  into  a  new  corporation  also  to  be  named  "Dehomag."  Through  a  cun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ning  twirl  of  losses  and  profits  among  the  four  German  companies,  and  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulating  balances  owed  by  those  subsidiaries  to  IBM  NY  for  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">"loans,"  Reich  profit  taxes  would  be  avoided,  despite  record  earnings  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  IBM  NY  would  simply  apply  the incomes  to  the  contrived  loans it  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">extended to  its own  subsidiaries.  IBM's  Maryland  division  was  used as  a con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duit  for  the  loan  transactions.  A  report  from  IBM's  accountants  to  the  corpo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate treasurer was explicit: "the motive for the merger was to effect an annual </p>
<p class="calibre1">pavings in taxes by reducing Dehomag's net profits by the amount of the net </p>
<p class="calibre1">losses of Optima and [old] Dehomag. . . about $30,000 annually."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  confirmed  in  a  special  report  to  Watson,  "As  the  merger  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Degemag,  [old]  Dehomag,  and  Optima  is  effected  .  .  .  corporation  profits  tax </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  out  of  the  question  ...  on  account  of  the  relief  from  [loan]  claims  of  IBM, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as thereby no profit, but merely a reduction of losses, is obtained."32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,  IBM  increased  its  investment  in  Dehomag  from  a  mere  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">400,000  to  more  than  RM  7  million—about  a  million  Depression-era  Ameri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  dollars.  This  would  include  a  million  Reichsmarks  to  purchase  new  land </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Berlin and build IBM's first German factory. IBM was tooling up for what it </p>
<p class="calibre1">correcdy  saw  as  a  massive  economic  relationship  with  the  Hitler  regime.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  midst  of  America's  Depression,  this  expansion  of  manufacturing  base </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  not  relieve  unemployment  in  the  United  States,  but  actually  transfer </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  jobs  to  Nazi  Germany  where  the  Hollerith  machines  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufactured.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understandably,  Watson  decided  to  visit  Germany  to  observe  condi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  first  hand,  which  he  did  on  October  13,  1933.  Despite  a  highly  publi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cized  boycott  against  German  ocean  liners,  he  ignored  picket  lines  and  sailed </p>
<p class="calibre1">on the German ship Bremen.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  impressed  with  what  he  saw  in  Berlin.  The  Watsons  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidingers  managed  many  happy  social  moments  together.  Mrs.  Watson  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked  Heidinger  for  a  copy  of  his  portrait  as  a  memento  of  their  joyous  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger sent two.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  also  visited  the  massive  census  operation  at  Alexanderplatz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  among  the  rows  of  data  clicking  clerks  arrayed  before  their  large </p>
<p class="calibre1">block-  letter  instructions  to  enter  Jews  in  Column  22  row  3,  amid  the  clatter </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  shiny,  black  sorters  flickering  punch  cards  into  a  blur,  Watson  was  moved </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  donate  money  to  buy  meals  for  everyone  at  IBM  expense.  As  an  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">gesture,  he  authorized  Dresden  pastries  for  each  and  every  member  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical  Office's  Census  Department.  Heidinger  later  wrote  to  Watson  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  total  bill  for  his  "bountiful  gift"  of  6,060  meals  disbursed  to  900  staffers </p>
<p class="calibre1">came in at just under 4,000 Reichsmarks.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  just  hot  meals  and  baked  goods,  Watson  wanted  to  make  sure </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  was  successful  and  effective.  He  personally  dispatched  Eugene </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hartley,  a  top  IBM  census  expert  and  manager  of  the  firm's  statistical  depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  to  advise  Dehomag.  Hartley  would  oversee  costs  in  Berlin  and  become </p>
<p class="calibre1">acquainted  with  all  details  of  Dehomag's  census  operation  and  its  methods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  details  were  to  be  recorded  in  a  special  handbook.  No  copies  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">exist. Senior management at Dehomag sent Watson an RCA Radiogram de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">claring.  "We  especially  appreciate  your  foresight  in  Bending  Mister  Hartley </p>
<p class="calibre1">who as a census expert is especially helpful to us at a time when we are </p>
<p class="calibre1">undertaking greatest service job ever done by any IBM agency."37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  gratifying  to  the  Germans  was  the  secret  pact  between  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Heidinger,  entered  into  that  October  1933,  while  Watson  was  touring </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. At a time when the Hitler government was declaring its war inten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions in Europe, Watson's secret deal granted Heidinger and Dehomag spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial commercial powers outside of Germany. Although there were IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">agencies and subsidiaries throughout Europe, Dehomag would be permitted </p>
<p class="calibre1">to circumvent and supplant each one, soliciting and delivering punch card </p>
<p class="calibre1">solution technology directly to IBM customers in those territories. That gave </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag entree to the major foreign corporations, foreign national railroads, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and foreign government offices across the Continent. IBM subsidiaries, such </p>
<p class="calibre1">as those in Brussels, Paris, and Warsaw would still exist. But now Nazified </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag could usurp their clients and even their manufacturing base.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  extraordinary  arrangement  virtually  reinvented  Dehomag  as  a  de </p>
<p class="calibre1">facto  "IBM  Europe."  Subject  to  IBM  NY  oversight,  the  German  subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  granted  free  rein  to  cultivate  its  special  brand  of  statistical  services  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  nearby  countries,  especially  Austria,  Czechoslovakia,  Poland,  Belgium, </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  and  Holland.  Where  census,  registration,  and  other  statistical  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  did  not  exist,  or  where  they  could  be  updated  along  the  lines  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's  anti-Semitic  model,  Dehomag  could  now  move  in.  In  essence,  before </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Third  Reich  advanced  across  any  border,  its  scientific  soldiers  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">already have a vital outpost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  its  new  potency  to  create  a  German  sphere  of  statistical  influence </p>
<p class="calibre1">across  the  continent,  no  wonder  senior  management  in  November  1933  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  a  jointly  signed  cable  proclaiming,  "Your  visit  to  Germany  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">brought encouragement not only to Dehomag, but to the German people."39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CONSIDERING  THE  far-reaching  importance  of  the  Watson-Heidinger  agree- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  for  commercial  hegemony,  and  the  certainty  of  upsetting  other  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries,  Watson  committed  nothing  to  paper  about  his  secret  territorial </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement with Heidinger. Deniability seemed to be the order of the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  Watson  possessed  an  understanding  of  the  value  of  deniability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  he  was  prosecuted  for  criminal  conspiracy  in  the  National  Cash  Regis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter  case,  he  was  confronted  by  exhibit  after  exhibit  of  his  own  incriminating </p>
<p class="calibre1">writings,  such  as  instructions  to  destroy  competitors  and  create  fake  compa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nies. That error would not happen again. Moreover, IBM was at that very </p>
<p class="calibre1">moment  being  prosecuted  by  the  U.S.  Justice  Department's  anti-trust  divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion  for  additional  secretive  acts  of  monopoly  and  unfair  competition  involv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing punch card technology.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  developed  an  extraordinary  ability  to  write  reserved  and  clev- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erly  cautious  letters.  More  commonly,  he  remained  silent  and  let  subordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nates  and  managers  do  the  writing  for  him.  But  they  too  respected  an  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">code—unwritten,  of  course—to  observe  as  much  discretion  as  possible  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">memos  and  correspondence.  This  was  especially  so  in  the  case  of  corre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sponding  with  or  about  Nazi  Germany,  the  most  controversial  business  part- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner of the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  a  few  weeks  after  Watson  left  Germany,  one  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  managers  in  Paris,  M.  G.  Connally,  was  assigned  to  monitor  details </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  merger  of  IBM's  four  subsidiaries.  On  November  18,  1933,  Connally </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  a  letter  to  Heidinger  concluding  with  the  sentiment:  "I  only  wish  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  someone  here  to  do  things  the  way  you  people  do  in  Germany."  Shortly </p>
<p class="calibre1">thereafter,  Connally  circulated  a  copy  of  that  letter  to  Watson  and  other  exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utives  at  IBM  NY.  Connally  sheepishly  scribbled  under  the  last  sentence,  "I </p>
<p class="calibre1">think now I shouldn't have said this."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether  or  not  Watson  wanted  to  keep  the  Dehomag  expansion  deal  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret,  Heidinger  was  clearly  irked  by  the  absence  of  any  proof  that  he  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">literally  invade  any  other  subsidiary's  territory.  Census  offices  and  other  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers  in  other  countries  would  be  surprised  if  abrupdy  contacted  by  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  agent.  And  any  IBM  subsidiary  manager  would  surely  challenge </p>
<p class="calibre1">a Dehomag attempt to steal its business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  many  months  of  waiting,  Heidinger  suddenly  demanded  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">written proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  August  27,  1934,  he  pointedly  cabled  Watson,  "We  need  urgendy  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable  and  following  letter  confirmation  for  our  right  granted  by  you  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonally  to  deliver  our  German  manufactured  machines  for  entire  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">market....  This  right  does  not  include  any  obligation  of  your  European  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">panies to give any orders."42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  gave  in.  The  next  day,  August  28,  he  dispatched  a  radiogram </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Berlin:  "Confirming  agreement  reached  between  us  last  conference  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin.  We  extend  German  company  rights  to  manufacture  machines  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  patents  for  all  European  countries.  Formal  contract  following  by  mail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Watson."43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  contract  that  followed  by  mail  was  not  acceptable  to  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mans.  Heidinger  detested  negotiating  with  Watson  and  bitterly  remembered </p>
<p class="calibre1">how he had lost his company during the post-War inflation. Now, during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  Hitler  era,  Watson  wanted  Dehomag  to  proliferate  punch  card  tech- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nology  throughout  the  continent,  generating  huge  contracts.  But  sales  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  funneled  through  the  local  IBM  subsidiaries  rather  than  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's blocked bank accounts. Heidinger reluctantly agreed, but didn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">trust Watson and insisted that he be vindicated not just with a new agree- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment,  but  written  confirmation  that  this  expansion  pact  was  originally  sealed </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost a year before.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So on September 11, Watson again cabled Heidinger: "Confirming </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement  reached  between  us  in  Berlin  October  1933.  We  extend  by  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement  your  company  rights  to  manufacture  and  to  sell  our  machines  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  European  Hollerith companies."  Watson  followed  it  up  with a  signed letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">confirmi n g  that  he  had  indeed  sent  the  cable,  and  quoting  the  exact  text.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable  and  letter  were  sent  to  Nazi  Germany.  In  America,  however,  the  car- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bons  were  carefully  placed  in  the  file  of  IBM  Financial  Vice  President  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">close  Watson  confidant,  Otto  E.  Braitmayer.  A  hand-scrawled  note  confirmed </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly  where  the  carbons  were  being  kept:  "Carbons  of  Letter  of  Septem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  11,  1934  to  Willy  Heidinger  in  which  Mr.  Watson  confirmed  cable  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sept  11  regarding  agreement  that  German  Co  has  rights  to  mfg  and  sell  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines to all Europe in Braitmayer files."45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deniability  in  the  face  of  the  undeniable  required  a  special  mindset.  At </p>
<p class="calibre1">every  twist  and  turn  of  IBM's  growing  relationship  with  Adolf  Hitler,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  other  executives  of  IBM  NY  were  confronted  with  four  undeniable </p>
<p class="calibre1">realities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,  barbaric  anti-Semitic  violence  and  general  repression  were  every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where  in  Germany  and  clearly  part  of  a  methodical  program  to  destroy  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews.  Second,  popular  and  diplomatic  protest  against  the  Hitler  regime  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">America,  and  indeed  throughout  the  world,  was  highly  visible  and  threaten- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  any  business  that  traded  with  Germany.  Third,  any  corporation  willing </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  ignore  the  moral  distaste  and  public  outcry  accepted  the  stark  realities  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">doing  business  in  the  Third  Reich:  unpredictable  local  and  national  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">personalities  and  regulations,  confiscatory  taxes,  revenues  trapped  in  blocked </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  bank  accounts  that  could  only  be  used  within  Germany,  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute  certainty  that  the  company  and  its  employees  would  be  integrated </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  the  fabric  of  the  Nazi  game  plan.  Fourth,  he  who  helped  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped Hitler prepare for war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anti-Semitic  violence  and  general  repression  in  Germany  was  an  unde- </p>
<p class="calibre1">niable  fact  for  all  in  America,  but  especially  for  anyone  who  could  read  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">front  page  or  the  first  few  pages  of  the  New  York  Times,  listen  to  a  radio </p>
<p class="calibre1">broadcast, or watch a newsreel. In the formative months of February, March, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and April 1911 Watson and h i s  colleagues at IBM were exposed to not just </p>
<p class="calibre1">several articles in the New York Times, but scoress of them each week detailing </p>
<p class="calibre1">ghastly anti-Semitic brutality. On many days, the New York papers were filled </p>
<p class="calibre1">with literally dozens of repression and atrocity reports. </p>
<p class="calibre1">March  18,  New  York  Times:  In  an  article  detailing  Nazi  plans  to  destroy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  professional  life,  the  paper  reported  that  a  quarter  of  all  Jewish  attor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">neys  would  be  forced  to  retire  each  year  until  they  were  all  gone.  It  wasn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  the  legal  profession.  Within  weeks  all  German  Jews  expected  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">ousted from their professional positions and occupations, the paper wrote.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">March  20,  New  York  Times:  The  page  one  center  headline  decried,  "Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Fugitives  Tell  of  Atrocities  at  Hands  of  Nazis."  Making  clear  that  "iron- </p>
<p class="calibre1">clad censorship" in Germany was preventing most of the truth from emerging, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  paper  nonetheless  enumerated  a  series  of  heinous  acts.  For  example,  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexanderplatz  in  Berlin,  just  down  the  street  from  the  Prussian  Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office  complex,  Brown  Shirts  invaded  a  restaurant  popular  with  Jewish  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nessmen.  Waving  a  list  of  names  of  the  restaurant's  Jewish  customers,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown  Shirts  "formed  a  double  line  to  the  restaurant  door."  They  called  each </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew  out  by  name  and  made  him  run  a  gauntlet.  As  a  Jew  passed,  each  Storm </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trooper  "smashed  him  in  the  face  and  kicked  him  with  heavy  boots,  until </p>
<p class="calibre1">finally  the  last  in  the  line,  knocked  him  into  the  street."  The  last  Jew  to  run </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  gaundet  was  beaten  so  severely,  "his  face  resembled  a  beefsteak,"  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspaper reported.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">March  21,  New  York  Times:  Under  a  page  one  banner  headline  declar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing, "Reichstag Meeting Today is Prepared to Give Hitler Full Control As Dic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tator,"  was  a  special  two-column  dispatch  from  Munich.  "Chief  of  Police </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himmler  of  Munich  today  informed  newspaper  men  here  that  the  first  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">several concentration camps will be established near this city."48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  April  20,  about  the  time  Watson  decided  IBM  should  solicit  the  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  project,  New  York  Times  headlines  reported  more  than  10,000  refugees </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  fled  Germany  in  the  face  of  daily  home  invasions,  tortures,  and  kidnap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pings;  30,000  more  were  already  imprisoned  in  camps  or  prisons;  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  100,000  were  facing  economic  ruination  and  even  starvation.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">May  10,  about the time  IBM  was  at  the height  of  its negotiations  for  the  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus,  the  world  was  further  shocked  when  Nazis  staged  their  first  and  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">publicized  mass  book  burning.  By  the  end  of  May,  when  Dehomag's  contract </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  Reich  was  finalized,  the  New  York  Times  and  the  rest  of  America's </p>
<p class="calibre1">media  had  continuously  published  detailed  accounts  of  Jews  being  brutally </p>
<p class="calibre1">ousted from one profession after another: judges ceremoniously marched </p>
<p class="calibre1">out of their courtrooms, lawyers pushed from their offices, doctors expelled </p>
<p class="calibre1">f r o m   t h e i r   c l i n i c s ,  professors drummed out of their classrooms, retailers </p>
<p class="calibre1">evicted from their own stores, and scientists barred from their own labs.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On June 11, the day before the door-to-door census taking began, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York Times reported that the government was searching through the </p>
<p class="calibre1">backgrounds of more than 350,000 government workers to identify which </p>
<p class="calibre1">among them might be of "Jewish extraction who are liable to dismissal." In </p>
<p class="calibre1">that same edition, the New York Times rendered a page-specific summary of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, explaining how completely public his pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gram of Jewish annihilation was. Hitler declared on page 344, reported the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York Times, "If at the beginning of the [Great] War, 12,000 or 15,000 of </p>
<p class="calibre1">these corrupters of the people [Jews] had been held under poison gas . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">12,000 scoundrels removed at the right time might perhaps have saved the </p>
<p class="calibre1">lives of one million proper Germans."50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  Watson  was  organizing  his  plans  to  set  sail  on  the  Bremen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  August  29,  1933,  the  New  York  Times,  in  a  page  one  article,  reported  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">exiustence  of  sixty-five  brutal  concentration  camps  holding  some  45,000  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  and  non-Jewish  inmates;  an  equal  number  were  incarcerated  at  a  variety </p>
<p class="calibre1">of other locations, creating a total of some 90,000 held.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Banner headlines, riveting radio broadcasts, and graphic newsreels </p>
<p class="calibre1">depicting the systematic destruction of Jewry's place in Germany must have </p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed endless. Blaring media reports made it impossible for anyone at IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">to deny knowledge of the situation in the Third Reich. But what made a </p>
<p class="calibre1">technologic alliance with the Reich even more difficult—moment-to-moment </p>
<p class="calibre1">- was an America that everywhere was loudly protesting the Hitler campaign </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Jewish destruction. To ally with Germany at that time meant going against </p>
<p class="calibre1">the will of an enraged nation—indeed an enflamed world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although anti-German protest marches, picket lines, boycotts, and noisy </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands to stop the atrocities were in full swing on every continent of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world, nowhere would protest have appeared more omnipresent than to a </p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman in New York City. In New York, the air burned with anti-Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">a g i t a t i o n .  All sectors of society—from labor unions to business leaders, from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catholic bishops to Protestant deacons to defiant rabbis—rallied behind the </p>
<p class="calibre1">battlee cry that humanity must starve Depression-battered Germany into </p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoning her anti-Semitic course. "Germany Will Crack This Winter," read </p>
<p class="calibre1">the placards and the leaflets.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Typical of the vehemence was the giant demonstration at Madison Square </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garden on March 27, 1933. Culminating days of loud marches throughout the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York-New  Jersey  area  and  highly  publicized  denunciations,  the  Madi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son Square Garden event was calculated to shut down New York—and it did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  noon  on  March  27,  business  stopped.  Stores  and  schools  closed </p>
<p class="calibre1">across  Greater  New  York  as  employees  were  released  for  the  day.  The  rally </p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't  start  until  after  8:00  P.M.,  but  by  that  afternoon,  large  crowds  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">already  lined  up  outside  the  Garden.  Once  the  doors  were  unlocked,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">flow  of  protesters  began.  It  continued  for  hours.  Traffic  snarled  as  thousands </p>
<p class="calibre1">jammed  the  streets  trying  to  wedge  closer.  Demonstrators  heading  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rally  were  backed  all  the  way  down  the  subway  stairs.  Six  hundred  police- </p>
<p class="calibre1">men  formed  a  bluecoat  chain  along  the  crosswalks  just  to  allow  pedestrians </p>
<p class="calibre1">to pass.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  doors  shut,  only  20,000  boycotters  made  it  inside.  So  public </p>
<p class="calibre1">loudspeakers  were  hastily  erected  for  an  estimated  35,000  keyed-up  citizens </p>
<p class="calibre1">crammed  around  the  streets  of  the  Garden.  Police  and  protest  marshals </p>
<p class="calibre1">diverted  several  thousand  to  a  second  ad  hoc  rally  at  nearby  Columbus  Cir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cle.  It  wasn't  enough.  More  overflow  rallies  were  frantically  set  up  along  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby intersections.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Synchronized  programs  were  at  that  moment  waiting  in  Chicago,  Wash- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ington,  Houston,  and  about  seventy  other  American  cities.  At  each  supportive </p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering,  thousands  huddled  around  loudspeakers  waiting  for  the  Garden </p>
<p class="calibre1">event  to  commence.  That  day,  at  least  one  million  Jews  participated  nation- </p>
<p class="calibre1">wide.  Perhaps  another  million  Americans  of  non-Jewish  heritage  stood  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  shoulder-to-shoulder.  Hundreds  of  thousands  more  in  Europe  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing sympathetic demonstrations, fasts, and boycotts.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  and  Thomas  Watson  had  never  seen  anything  like  it.  From </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  windows  of  IBM  at  270  Broadway,  the  massive  demonstration  was  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">unmistakable  message:  Don't  do  business  with  Hitler.  Moreover,  boycott </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaders promised vigilant retaliation for any American firm that did.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Protests,  larger  and  smaller  than  the  one  on  March  27,  were  repeated </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout the year and indeed throughout the life of the Third Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  stakes  must  have  been  high  for  Watson  to  disregard  the  gargan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tuan  protest  of  a  nation,  and  the  world's  battle  cry  to  isolate  Germany  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercially.  But  IBM  maintained  its  steadfast  commitment  to  an  alliance  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  Germany.  It  was  just  days  later  that  Watson  launched  the  effort  to  gar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner the Prussian census contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germans  understood  Watson  to  be  a  friend  of  the  Reich.  Just  after  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madison  Square  Garden  event,  senior  management  at  Dehomag  sent  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">company Leader a joindy signed appeal on firm letterhead. German man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agers  implored  Watson  to  help  suppress  the  "cruelty  stories  depicting  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tended  abominable  crimes  against  German  jews  ...  [which]  are  untrue."  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">word  "Jews"  was  not  capitalized.  Heidinger  could  not  bring  himself  to  capi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">talize  the  lett er   "J"  when  typing  the  word  "German"  next  to  the  word  Jew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  are  applying  to  our  esteemed  foreign  personal  and  business  friends," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  wrote,  "with  the  most  urgent  request,  not  only  to  reciprocate  our </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  but—as  champions  of  truth—not  only  not  to  believe  similar </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfounded </p>
<p class="calibre1">rumors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">set </p>
<p class="calibre1">yourselves </p>
<p class="calibre1">against </p>
<p class="calibre1">them."57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  did  not  disappoint  his  colleagues  in  Berlin.  Just  after  the  world- </p>
<p class="calibre1">wide  rallies  in  late  March,  Dehomag  board  meetings  in  Berlin  confirmed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"President  Watson  and  vice  president  Braitmayer  were  fully  agreed  that  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">should  manufacture  all  suitable  items  in  Germany  according  to  our  best </p>
<p class="calibre1">lights  and  by  our  own  decision."  Hence,  plans  to  establish  a  factory  were  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">proceed, even though certain highly technical parts would still be imported </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the United States. Watson's office routinely received translated copies </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the meeting minutes a few days later.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's commitment to growing German operations seemed indefati- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gable. He ignored the tide of America's anti-Nazi movement and the risk of </p>
<p class="calibre1">being discovered as a commercial associate of the Third Reich. But doing so </p>
<p class="calibre1">meant ignoring the inescapable financial risk any businessman could see in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi Germany. Simply put, doing business in Germany was dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foreign business was fundamentally considered an enemy of the Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man State. Incomes earned by foreign corporations could not be transferred </p>
<p class="calibre1">overseas. They were sequestered in blocked German bank accounts. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">money was usable, but only in Germany. Hence, a dollar of profit made by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag could only be spent in Germany, binding any foreign enterprise to </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued economic development within Germany. Companies were fre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quently required to invest their profits in Reich bonds. Many considered this </p>
<p class="calibre1">monetary move little more than Hitler's effort to take American business </p>
<p class="calibre1">hostage.  Others  understood  that  as  corporations  fled  Germany,  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">was forced to decree that their money would have to remain behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  Paris  office  began  regularly  receiving  statements  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deutsche  Bank  und  Disconto-Gesellschaft,  listing  Dehomag's  distributions  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">blocked  funds  in  the  name  of  International  Business  Machines  Corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  one  account  balance  of  RM  188,896  was  suddenly  boosted  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">RM 90,000—almost none of which could be sent back to America.59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rapid-fire regulations designed to subdue the independence of foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">business were being promulgated almost daily. Often regional rules were </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply decreed by a local party potentate. Companies were obligated to fire </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, hire from the ranks of the NSDAP - the Nazi Party - pay special contri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">butions,  and  sometimes  even  defer  plans  for  mechanization  on  the  theory </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  certain  types  of  machinery  displaced  jobs.  Conflicting  rules  from  conflic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ting authorities were commonplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  all,  Germany  loudly  warned  all  foreign  business  that  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  to  a  concept  known  as  Gleichschaltung  loosely  translated  as  "total </p>
<p class="calibre1">coordination"  with  the  State.  Within  days  of  Hitler's  rise  to  power,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">process  of  Gleichschaltung  began  as  every  political,  organizational,  and  social </p>
<p class="calibre1">structure  within  German  society  was  integrated  into  the  Nazi  movement  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore  made  subordinate  to  NSDAP  goals  and  instructions.  Gleichschal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tung  applied  to  business  as  well.  Foreign  business  quickly  realized  it.  And </p>
<p class="calibre1">they were reminded often.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">April  7,  1933,  New  York  Times:  A  page  one  article  bannered  "Nazis  Seize </p>
<p class="calibre1">Power  to  Rule  Business;  Our  Firms  Alarmed,"  led  with  the  assertion,  "Adolf </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler,  having  made  himself  political  dictator  of  Germany,  today  became  dic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tator  of  German  big  business  as  well."  The  New  York  Times  explained  that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"every  phase  of  German  business  had  already  been  thoroughly  organized.  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">taking  control  of  the  business  organizations,  the  Nazis  have  obtained  control </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the interests they represent."61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">April  28,  1933,  New  York  Times:  In  an  article  headlined  "Germany  Cau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  Foreign  Business,"  the  newspaper  prominendy  reported  a  promulgation </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Reich  Economics  Undersecretary  Paul  Bang,  "The  German  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  must  demand  that  foreign  business  establishments  unreservedly  partici- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pate in the realization of Germany's economic program."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  complete  the  circle  of  apprehension,  everywhere  the  talk  was  of  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">newed  war.  Any  economic  transfusion to the  Hitler regime  was  seen  by  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  a  mere  prelude  to  another  horrific  military  conflict.  Officials  in  Washing- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ton,  diplomats  in  London  and  Paris,  and  business  leaders  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  feared  that  the  advent  of  Hitler  would  throw  humanity  back  into  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">global  war.  Signs  of  German  rearmament  were  reported  continuously.  Open </p>
<p class="calibre1">declarations  by  Germany  that  it  would  reoccupy  tracts  of  land  seized  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">victorious  Allies  were  blared  throughout  the  media.  A  key  source  of  alarm </p>
<p class="calibre1">was Hitler's so-called employment program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  was  disarmed  as  part  of  the  Versailles  Treaty.  Now  labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">forces  were  becoming  facades  for  military  recruitment.  Organized  "labor </p>
<p class="calibre1">units"  were  subject  to  conscription,  wore  uniforms,  and  underwent  paramili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  training.  Typical  was  a  New  York  Times  report  on  May  21  headlined </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reich  Issues  Orders  for  New  Labor  Units."  The  subhead  read,  "Military </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tone Is Evident in the Conscription Regulations—Storm Troops Favored."63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why would one of America's leading businessmen and his premier cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">p o r a t i o n   r i s k   a l l   b y   p a r t i c i p a t i n g  in a Nazi economy sworn to destroy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry, subjugate Europe, and dominate all enterprises within its midst? For one, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's economic entanglements with Nazi Germany remained beneath public </p>
<p class="calibre1">perception. Few understood the far-reaching ramifications of punch card </p>
<p class="calibre1">technology and even fewer had a foreground understanding that the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany Dehomag was in fact essentially a wholly-owned subsidiary of Interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional Business Machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boycott and protest movements were ardently trying to crush Hitlerism </p>
<p class="calibre1">by stopping Germany's exports. Although a network of Jewish and non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sectarian anti-Nazi leagues and bodies struggled to organize comprehensive </p>
<p class="calibre1">lists of companies doing business with Germany, from importers of German </p>
<p class="calibre1">toys  and  shoes  to  sellers  of  German  porcelain  and  pharmaceuticals,  yet  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Watson  were  not  identified.  Neither  the  company  nor  its  president  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared  in  any  of  thousands  of  hectic  phone  book  entries  or  handwritten </p>
<p class="calibre1">index  card  files  of  the  leading  national  and  regional  boycott  bodies.  Anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  agitators  just  didn't  understand  the  dynamics  of  corporate  multi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalism.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  IBM  was  not  importing  German  merchandise,  it  was  export- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  machinery.  In  fact,  even  exports  dwindled  as  soon  as  the  new  plant  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  was  erected,  leaving  less  of  a  paper  trail.  So  a  measure  of  invisibility </p>
<p class="calibre1">was assured in 1933. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  to  a  certain  extent  all  the  worries  about  granting  Hitler  the  techno- </p>
<p class="calibre1">logic  tools  he  needed  were  all  subordinated  to  one  irrepressible,  ideological </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperative.  Hitler's  plans  for  a  new  Fascist  order  with  a  "Greater  Germany" </p>
<p class="calibre1">dominating  all  Europe  were  not  unacceptable  to  Watson.  In  fact,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">admired  the  whole  concept  of  Fascism.  He  hoped  he  could  participate  as  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  capitalistic counterpart  of the  great  Fascist  wave  sweeping  the  Con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinent. Most of all, Fascism was good for business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THOMAS  WATSON  and  IBM  had  separately  and  jointly  spent  decades  making </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  any  way  they  could.  Rules  were  broken.  Conspiracies  were  hatched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bloody  wars  became  mere  market  opportunities.  To  a  supranational,  making </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  is  equal  parts  commercial  Darwinism,  corporate  ecclesiastics,  dynastic </p>
<p class="calibre1">chauvinism, and solipsistic greed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  no  Fascist.  He  was  a  pure  capitalist.  But  the  horseshoe  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">political  economics  finds  little  distance  between  extremities.  Accretion  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth by and for the state under a strong autocratic leader fortified by jin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">goism  and  hero  worship  was  appealing  to  Watson.  After  all,  his  followers </p>
<p class="calibre1">wore  uniforms,  sang  songs,  and  were  expected  to  display  unquestioned  loy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">alty to the company he led. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fascism,  the  dictatorial  state-controlled  political  system,  was  invented </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Italian  Dictator  Benito  Mussolini.  The  term  symbolically  derived  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roman  fasces,  that  is,  the  bundle  of  rods  surrounding  a  ceremonial  axe  used </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  Roman  times.  Indeed,  Nazi  symbols  and  ritual  were  in  large  part </p>
<p class="calibre1">adopted  from  Mussolini,  including  the  palm-lifting  Roman  salute.  Ironically, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Italian  Fascism  was  non-racial  and  not  anti-Semitic. National  Socialism  added </p>
<p class="calibre1">those defining elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mussolini  fascinated  Watson.  Once,  at  a  1937  sales  convention,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke  out  in  Il  Duce's  defense.  "I  want  to  pay  tribute  ...  [to  the]  great  leader, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Benito  Mussolini,"  declared  Watson.  "I  have  followed  the  details  of  his  work </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  carefully  since  he  assumed  leadership  [in  1922].  Evidence  of  his  leader- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ship  can  be  seen  on  all  sides.  .  .  .  Mussolini is  a  pioneer  .  .  .  Italy  is  going  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">benefit gready."65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  explained  his  personal  attraction  to  the  dictator's  style  and  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">observed  similarities  with  his  own  corporate,  capitalistic  model.  "One  thing </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  has  greatly  impressed  me  in  connection  with  his  leadership,"  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceded Watson, "is the loyalty displayed by the people. To have the loyalty and </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  of  everyone  means  progress—and  ultimate  success  for  a  nation </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  an  individual  business  ...  we  should  pay  tribute  to  Mussolini  for  estab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lishing this spirit of loyal support and cooperation."66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  years,  an  autographed  picture  of  Mussolini  graced  the  grand  piano </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Watson's living room.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  defense  of  Fascism,  Watson  made  clear,  "Different  countries  require </p>
<p class="calibre1">different  forms  of  government  and  we  should  be  careful  not  to  let  people  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  countries  feel  that  we  are  trying  to  standardize  principles  of  govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment throughout the world."68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Years  after  der  Fuhrer  seized  power,  Watson  drafted  a  private  letter  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  Economics  Minister  Hjalmar  Schacht,  in  which  he  argued  "the  neces- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sity  of  extending  a  sympathetic  understanding  to  the  German  people  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  aims  under  the  leadership  of  Adolf  Hitler."  Watson  described  Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">threatening  posture  toward  other  nations  as  a  "dynamic  policy."  In  referring </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  "heroic  sacrifices  of  the  German  people  and  the  greatest  achievements </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  their  present  leadership,"  Watson  declared,  "It  is  the  sincere  and  earnest </p>
<p class="calibre1">desire  entertained  by  me  and  coundess  other  friends  of  Germany  .  .  .  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">these  sacrifices  and  achievements  should  be  successful  and  that  the  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany should reap the fruits of its present great effort to the fullest </p>
<p class="calibre1">extent." Watson concluded the draft with "an expression of my highest </p>
<p class="calibre1">esteem for himself [Hitler], his country and his people."69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">W a t s o n  was equally appreciated and admired by Fascists, especially in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany. In its struggle with the democratic governments and popular </p>
<p class="calibre1">movements that opposed Germany's anti-Semitic drive, Nazis gready valued </p>
<p class="calibre1">their unexpected and influential ally. To them, it was a subde green light of </p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet approval because Watson seemed, in the Nazi mentality, to speak for </p>
<p class="calibre1">more than one American firm—he seemed to represent President Franklin D. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt and indeed America itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  man  who  began  his  career  as  a  turn-of-the-century  horse-and- </p>
<p class="calibre1">buggy peddler had graduated to become America's number one private </p>
<p class="calibre1">international  statesman.  Watson  used  charitable  donations  to  telescope  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  importance.  The  roll  call  of  honorary  appointments  of  power  and  pres- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tige  was  long  and  enviable.  He  was  the  chairman  of  the  Carnegie  Endow- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  for  Peace,  trustee  of  New  York  University,  and  chairman  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">American section of the International Chamber of Commerce—and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">lengthy  gilded  list  proceeded  from  there.  In  fact,  in  the  very  days  before  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  awarded  Dehomag  the  census  contract,  American  newspapers  promi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nently reported that Watson had been both nominated unopposed as a </p>
<p class="calibre1">director  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  appointed  trustee  of  Columbia </p>
<p class="calibre1">University.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  access  to  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull,  and  more  importantly  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt,  was  unparalleled.  While  the  Hoover  Justice </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  was  at  the  height  of  its  anti-trust  investigation  of  IBM  in  1932, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  donated  large  sums  to  the  Roosevelt  campaign.  Roosevelt's  election </p>
<p class="calibre1">over Hoover was a landslide. Watson now had entree to the White House </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  carefully  curried  favor  with  Roosevelt  by  publicly  supporting </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  of  his  more  controversial  policies.  Soon,  Watson  was  sending  policy </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestions  to  the  President.  The  two  men  began  to  correspond  regularly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  so  proud  of  the  letters,  some  of  them  mere  presidential  tokens, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  would  carry  them  around  in  a  pocket,  showing  them  off  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">moment would permit.72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,  Roosevelt  came  to  rely  on  Watson  for  advice.  White  House </p>
<p class="calibre1">staffers  would  occasionally  ask  for  Watson's  schedule  in  case  the  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  to  contact  him  quickly.  Watson  visited  Hyde  Park  for  tea  several </p>
<p class="calibre1">times  and  even  stayed  overnight  at  the  White  House.  Eventually,  Roosevelt </p>
<p class="calibre1">offered to appoint Watson Secretary of Commerce or Ambassador to England. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Watson declined to leave IBM.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead  Watson's  son  remembers,  "he  served  unofficially  as  Roosevelt's </p>
<p class="calibre1">representative  in  New  York."  If  a  foreign  dignitary  arrived,  the  White  House </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  ask  Watson  to  stage  an  honorary  luncheon.  "All  Father  had  to  do  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">press  a  button,"  his  son  remembers.  "He  had  a  whole  department  that  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  but  set  up  company  dinners  and  other  functions  ...  all  at  IBM  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pense."  Indeed,  Roosevelt  once  remarked,  "I  handle  'em  in  Washington  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom handles 'em in New York."74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  leveraged  his  position  with  the  Administration  to  develop </p>
<p class="calibre1">extensive  contacts  with  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull,  numerous  ambas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sadors  and  consuls,  and  the  State  Department  in  general.  Cloaked  in  official- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dom,  Watson  never  failed  to  undertake  the  often  months-long  process  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">formally  soliciting  official  greetings  to  private  functions  from  Roosevelt,  Hull, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  other  Administration  luminaries.  These  letters,  often  gratuitous,  broadcast </p>
<p class="calibre1">arcs  of  power  to  those  observing  overseas,  especially  in  a  Reich  that  believed </p>
<p class="calibre1">in bigger-than-life personages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  wonder  Nazi  Germany  considered  Watson  a  very  powerful  friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  when  in  October  1933  Dehomag  encountered  unexpectedly  high </p>
<p class="calibre1">customs  duties  on  IBM  machinery  it  hoped  to  import  as  part  of  its  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">expanded  portfolio,  Heidinger  wrote  a  thinly  veiled  threat  to  Reich  Customs </p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucrats.  "The  president  of  our  American  co-associate,  the  International </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  Machines  .  .  .  Mr.  Watson,  is  one  of  the  most  prominent  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">personalities,"  asserted  Heidinger.  "Among  other  things,  he  is  one  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-known  25  intimate  counselors  of  President  Roosevelt,  president  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  Chamber  of  Commerce  . . .   he  also  holds  many,  many  other  posi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  of  honor  in  the  United  States.  In  keeping  with  his  friendliness  for  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many,  proven  at  all  times,  he  has  up  to  now  done  everything  possible  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared  to  be  to  the  interest  of  Germany.  I  am  quite  sure  that  Mr.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  never  understand  ...  a  country  to  raise  supplementary  customs  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  his  machines."  Heidinger  added,  "I  do  not  know  what  the  attitude  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  above-named  would  be  if  the  customs  increase  were  permitted.  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">am  recommending,"  Heidinger  concluded,  "that  the  above  facts  be  placed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  knowledge  of  the  two  gentlemen  [customs  officers]  examining  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">situation."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  did  everything  he  could  to  reinforce  in  Germany  his  image  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  American  potency  and  friendship.  The  German  consul  in  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  a  houseguest  at  Watson's  home,  and  Watson  insisted  on  arranging  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">him  complimentary  country  club  privileges  at  the  IBM  Country  Club.  His </p>
<p class="calibre1">socializing  with  the  German  Ambassador  was  equally  robust,  making  certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">that special invitations for luncheons and dinners were regularly circulated </p>
<p class="calibre1">to German diplomats, and punctual acceptance or gracious regrets were sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">in response to heirs.76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So a happy  medium  was found  between  Watson's desire to maintain </p>
<p class="calibre1">deniability in IBM's lucrative relations with Germany and his personal desire </p>
<p class="calibre1">to hobnob with Third Reich VIPs. But, the demands of the growing business </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Germany would not be free of Watson's famous micro-management. Too </p>
<p class="calibre1">much was at stake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson would travel to Germany regularly during the thirties for first- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand information about the situation in the Nazi Reich. These visits would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be augmented by his personal New York representatives who would monitor </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag on-site for months at a time. Verbatim translations of Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">voluminous memos, correspondence, even routine bureaucratic forms and </p>
<p class="calibre1">applications,  were  continuously  transmitted  to  IBM  in  New  York  for  review </p>
<p class="calibre1">and comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson had created the IBM Europe office, headquartering it in Paris </p>
<p class="calibre1">and then Geneva, to function as the eyes and ears of the New York office in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe. When Watson's personal representatives were not in Germany, contin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uous upervision of Dehomag was effected by executives in the Swiss branch </p>
<p class="calibre1">of IBM, and often the Paris office. More than just routine oversight of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German operation, the Swiss office of IBM would become the all-important </p>
<p class="calibre1">nexus for instructions, profit funneling, and continent-wide coordination </p>
<p class="calibre1">in support of Dehomag's technologic activities throughout Europe. The com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bination of Watson's micro-management from afar and persistent Swiss </p>
<p class="calibre1">examination gave IBM an ever-present hour-to-hour grasp of the smallest </p>
<p class="calibre1">operational details at Dehomag, from miniscule bank discrepancies amount- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing to just a few dollars to the most vital issues facing the subsidiary's rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions with the Nazi regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  very  first  moments  and  continuing  throughout  the  twelve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">year  existence  of  the  Third  Reich,  IBM  placed  its  technology  at  the  disposal </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Hitler's  program  of  Jewish  destruction  and  territorial  domination.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  not  invent  Germany's  anti-Semitism,  but  when  it  volunteered  solutions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company  virtually  braided  with  Nazism.  Like  any  technologic  evolution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">each  new  solution  powered  a  new  level  of  sinister  expectation  and  cruel </p>
<p class="calibre1">capability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Germany  wanted  to  identify  the  Jews  by  name,  IBM  showed </p>
<p class="calibre1">them  how.  When  Germany  wanted  to  use  that  information  to  launch  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">grams  of  social  expulsion  and  expropriation,  IBM  provided  the  technologic </p>
<p class="calibre1">wherewithal.  When  the  trains  needed  to  run  on  time,  from  city  to  city  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">between concentration camps, IBM offered that solution as well. Ultimately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  was  no  solution  IBM  would  not  devise  for  a  Reich  willing  to  pay  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">services  rendered.  One  solution  led  to  another.  No  solution  was  out  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  clock  ticked,  as  the  punch  cards  clicked,  as  Jews  in  Germany  saw </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  existence  vaporizing,  others  saw  their  corporate  fortunes  rise.  Even  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  Jewry  hid  in  their  homes  and  wept  in  despair,  even  as  the  world </p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly  trembled  in  fear,  there  was  singing.  Exhilarated,  mesmerized,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful  would  sing,  and  sing  loudly  to  their  Leaders—on  both  sides  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Atlantic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some uniforms were brown. Some were blue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4 THE   I B M - N A Z I   ALLIANCE </p>
<p class="calibre1">WILLY        HEIDINGER      HATED        THOMAS        WATSON.        BITTER    </p>
<p class="calibre1">AND  defiant,  Heidinger  saw  Watson  as  the  incarnation  of  the  financial </p>
<p class="calibre1">calamity </p>
<p class="calibre1">that </p>
<p class="calibre1">had </p>
<p class="calibre1">befallen </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great </p>
<p class="calibre1">War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger had possessed the vision in 1910 to introduce Hollerith's contraption </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  Germany.  He  founded  a  company,  Dehomag,  to  bring  data  processing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  country.  But  for the  monetary  manipulations  that  arose  after World  War  I, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Diktat  of  the  Versailles  Treaty,  and  the  wild  ensuing  hyperinflation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenties, Heidinger would still own that company.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in 1922, worthless German currency was devalued by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the hour. Heidinger was unable to remit some $104,000 in royalties </p>
<p class="calibre1">in CTR, the IBM predecessor company, because it amounted to </p>
<p class="calibre1">trillions of inflated  Reiehsmarks that were impossible to obtain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson seized upon Germany's inflation crisis to take possession of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. Daring contentious negotiations, Watson first offered to </p>
<p class="calibre1">demur on the royalty debt in exchange for 51 percent of the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany. Heidinger felt it was better to own nearly half of a going con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cern than all of a bankrupt one. So he agreed to yield half of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. But then Watson abrupdy upped the demand from 51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of Dehomag to 90 percent. Heidinger felt "cornered" by his </p>
<p class="calibre1">own private Diktat. Under Watson's new terms, Heidinger would own </p>
<p class="calibre1">10 percent—or nothing. Watson had outmaneuvered Heidinger.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  more  than  a  decade  earlier.  But  Heidinger  never  forgot  it.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">spent the rest of his career biting back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson,  on  the  other  hand,  was  a  steel-nerved  businessman.  He  saw  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  takeover  of  1922  as  just  another  opportunity  to  swoop  up  a  lucra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive  business  for  virtually  nothing.  What  could  be  more  natural?  Hating  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  contact  was  of  no  use  to  a  man  like  Watson.  Heidinger  merely  rep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">resented a factor to control in the pursuit of profits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Heidinger  was  woven  from  too  much  feisty  fabric.  His  austere  face </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled  tight  over  high  cheekbones  beneath  a  worried  brow  framed  the  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">picture  of  contentiousness.  "I  would  be  the  last  to  submit  to  domina- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion,"  Heidinger  wrote  to  IBM's  Nazi  oversight  panel  in  recalling  his  dislike </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Watson.  "I  do  not,  as  a  matter  of  principle,  let  anyone  tell  me  to  do </p>
<p class="calibre1">anything."3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warlike  in  his  business  demeanor,  Heidinger  enjoyed  corporate  combat </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  tenacious  lawsuits.  He  could  litigate  a  narrow  commercial  issue  for  years </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  obstruct  a  crucial  company  program  at  the  eleventh  hour  unless  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">received  his  due.  Like  Hollerith  himself,  Heidinger  was  willing  to  battle  col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leagues  as  well  as  adversaries.  An  IBM  assessment  of  Heidinger  termed  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  "hardened  survivor"  whose  "life  ..  .  was  not  a  serene  one."  The  description </p>
<p class="calibre1">added, "He throve on fights."4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  just  volatile  and  unpredictable,  no  one  at  IBM  trusted  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger.  Company  executives  constantly  suspected  him  of  chiseling  IBM  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">small  and  large  sums,  and  thwarting  their  routine  audits  to  identify  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts.  "Mr.  Heidinger  is  a  very  selfish  man,"  wrote  one  IBM  auditor  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  spring  1934  tried  to  verify  Dehomag's  tax  information.  At  about  that  time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  IBM  auditor  in  Paris  reported  back  to  the  New  York  office,  "Just  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">order  to  avoid  any  misunderstanding,  we  wish  to  advise  that  we  are  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware  of  what  is  taking  place  .  .  .  insofar  as  the  recording  of  the  inventories </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  closing  of  the  books  is  concerned."  The  company's  staid  blue-suited </p>
<p class="calibre1">accountants  learned  to  be  reluctant  in  approaching  Heidinger  less  they  incur </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  volcanic  temper.  In  that  vein,  another  auditor, also  writing  in  spring  1934, </p>
<p class="calibre1">complained,  "it  is  practically  impossible  to  do  anything  by  correspondence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">due to the fear of unduly exciting our German friends."5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  before  Hitler  seized  power,  IBM  had  profited  enormously  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag.  By  1927,  profits  had  returned  more  than  400  percent  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase  price.6  Now,  as  part  of  the  Third  Reich's  industrial  team,  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">future  was  catapulting.  Nazi  demands  for  a  universe  of  punch  card  applica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  promised  horizonless  profits.  Merged  IBM  entities,  a  Europe-wide  ter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ritory, and a new factory presaged a magnificent new Dehomag whose </p>
<p class="calibre1">fortune  would  rise  along  with  the  fortune  of  the   Third  Reich.  Yet  who  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">prosper?  Would  it  be  the  German  people?  the  Aryan  race?  Heidinger  person- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally? No. It would be Watson and IBM. Heidinger roiled at the prospect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, Watson would not tolerate even a spark of rebellious man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">agement, let alone continuous insolent defiance. It was indeed a measure of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's indispensable importance to IBM's long-range global goals that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the micro-managing, egocentric Watson would endure clash after clash with </p>
<p class="calibre1">his own executives in Germany. Likewise, Heidinger was resourceful and </p>
<p class="calibre1">energetic enough to walk away from any distasteful foreign enterprise and </p>
<p class="calibre1">pursue his own commercial dominion. In truth, the two men desperately </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed each oilier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson needed Heidinger's connections to the NSDAP to turn Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">plans into IBM profits. And he needed Heidinger's cooperation if those </p>
<p class="calibre1">profits were to discreetly detour around the Reich payment moratorium. One </p>
<p class="calibre1">method was requiring its own German subsidiary to pay IBM "royalties." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revenues could then be deemed a "necessary expense" to Dehomag rather </p>
<p class="calibre1">than a profit to the parent company. Dehomag monies could occasionally be </p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitted to IBM in this form. As IBM's European manager reassured New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York executives in a 1934 letter, Dehomag Manager Herman Rottke promised </p>
<p class="calibre1">to "pull every wire and use every effort to continue [royalty] payments."7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Heidinger's part, he needed Watson to arm the statistical soldiers of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Third Reich for the coming war against European Jewry and territorial </p>
<p class="calibre1">conquest. For now, the machines would still be imported from the United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States. But even after the new factory was rushed into operation, allowing </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith machines to be manufactured in Berlin, the precious punch cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">themelves, painstakingly produced to an exacting specification, could still </p>
<p class="calibre1">be ordered from only one source: IBM in the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both men would vault their tempers and stratagems across the Atlantic </p>
<p class="calibre1">as Heidinger labored to expand Dehomag's commercial cooperation with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Reich, and Watson struggled to retain all the profits, often cutting Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger out. </p>
