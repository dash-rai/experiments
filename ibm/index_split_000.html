<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  the  stunning  story  of  IBM's  strategic  alliance  with  </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  Germany - beginning in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power </p>
<p class="calibre1">and continuing well into World War II. As the Third Reich embarked upon its </p>
<p class="calibre1">plan of conquest and genocide, IBM and its subsidiaries helped create enabling </p>
<p class="calibre1">technologies,  step-by-step,  from  the  identification  and  cataloging  programs  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  1930s  to  the  selections  of  the  1940s.  Only  after  Jews  were  identified  -  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done immediately - could they be </p>
<p class="calibre1">targeted  for  efficient  asset  confiscation,  ghettoization,  deportation,  enslaved </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iabor, and, ultimately, annihilation. It was a cross-tabulation and organizational </p>
<p class="calibre1">challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no </p>
<p class="calibre1">computer existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">But  IBM's  Hollerith  punch  card technology  did  exist. Aided by the company's </p>
<p class="calibre1">custom-designed  and  constantly  updated  Hollerith  svstems,  Hitler  was  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">automate  his  persecution  of  the  Jews.  Historians  have  always  been  amazed  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  speed  and  accuracy  with  which  the  Nazis  were  able  to  identify  and  locate </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  Jewry.  Until  now,  the  pieces  of  this  puzzle  have  never  been  fully </p>
<p class="calibre1">assem-bled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Germany  and  then  Nazi  Europe,  from  the  identification  of  the  Jews  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">censuses,  registrations,  and  ancestral  tracing  programs  to  the  running  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">railroads and organiz-ing of concentration camp slave labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  its  German  subsidiary  custom-designed  complex  solutions,  one  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">one, anticipating the Reich's needs. They did not merely sell the machines and </p>
<p class="calibre1">walk  away.  Instead,  IBM  leased  these  machines  for  high  fees  and  became  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sole source of the billions of punch cards Hitler needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  and  the  Holocaust  takes  you  through  the  carefully  crafted  corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">collusion  with  the  Third  Reich,  as  well  as  the  structured  deniability  of  oral </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreements,  undated  letters,  and  the  Geneva  intermediaries—all  undertaken  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the newspapers blazed with accounts ot persecution and destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as compelling is the human drama of one of our century's  greatest minds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  founder  Thomas  Watson,  who  cooperated  with  the  Nazis  for  the  sake  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">profit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  with  IBM's  technologic  assistance  was  Hitler  able  to  achieve  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">staggering  numbers  of  the Holocaust.  Edwin  Black  has  now  uncovered  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the last great mysteries of Germany's war against the Jews - how did Hitler get </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">names? </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">What  Reviewers Have Said A b o u t  </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  AND THE  HOLOCAUST </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An  explosive  new  book.  .  .  .  Backed  by  exhaustive  research,  Black's  case  is  simple </p>
<p class="calibre1">and stunning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Michael Hirsh, Newsweek </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  book  is  most  interesting  when  he  is  dealing  with  Watson's  stubborn  and  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">successful  determination  to  continue  in  control  of  IBM's  German  operation  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">appearing  to  be  doing  so.  He  was  able  to  cut  off  direct  relations  between  IBM  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  and  the  Germans  while  continuing  to  deal  with  them  indirectly.  He  was  a  master </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  subterfuge  and  made  a  fine  art  of  being  in  a  position  to  deny  collaboration  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Nazis  while  operating  through  subsidiaries  who  were  responsive  to  his  every  wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  And  he  never  forbade  them  to  supply  IBM  machines  that  were  used  in  sending </p>
<p class="calibre1">people to camps, which they did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Gordon A. Craig, New York Review of Books </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black  establishes  beyond  dispute  that  IBM  Hollerith  machines  significantly  advanced </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  efforts  to  exterminate  Jewry....  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  a  valuable  contribution </p>
<p class="calibre1">to our understanding of the Holocaust." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Christopher Simpson, Washington Post Book World </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  study  .  .  .  contains  a  wealth  of  unknown  or  little-known  details.  The  author </p>
<p class="calibre1">convincingly  shows  the  relendess  efforts  made  by  IBM  to  maximize  profit  by  selling </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  machines  and  its  punch  cards  to  a  country  whose  criminal  record  would  soon  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">widely recognized." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Saul Friedlander, Los Angeles Times </p>
<p class="calibre1">"IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  a  disturbing  book—all  the  more  so  because  its  author </p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn't  prescribe  what  should  be  done  about  sins  committed  more  than  half  a  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tury ago. It is left to readers to decide." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Ron Grossman, Chicago Tribune </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  book  is  shocking.  Its  contents  go  against  the  grain  of  all  that  is  dear  to  naive </p>
<p class="calibre1">images  of  corporate  America.  .  .  .  This  book  will  be  a  case  study  in  corporate  ethics </p>
<p class="calibre1">for years to come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Robert Urekew, Midstream </p>
<p class="calibre1">"IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  an  ambitious  book  . . .   an  important  contribution  to  Holo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">caust studies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—John Friedman, The Nation </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  book  adds  much  to  our  knowledge  of  the  Holocaust  and  World  War  II.  Black </p>
<p class="calibre1">convincingly  demonstrates  the  extent  to  which  it  [IBM  technology],  was  central  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the operation of the Third Reich." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Terry W. Hartle, Christian Science Monitor </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black  makes  a  case  that  shames  the  IBM  of  the  mid-20th  century....  There  will  be  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">question  ...  in  the  minds  of  readers  that  IBM  officials  had  the  ability  to  understand </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  task  their  machines  were  performing.  The  book  succeeds  as  a  piece  of  excruciat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ingly documented journalism." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Karen Sandstrom, Cleveland Plain Dealer </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  book  is  so  enlightening  [because]  it  paints  a  richly  textured  picture  of  how  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  [Watson],  and  an  entire  company,  can  ignore  all  sense  of  morality  while  not  once </p>
<p class="calibre1">transgressing  the  lines  of  business  ethics.  If  nothing  else,  this  book  should  be  required </p>
<p class="calibre1">reading for every first-year MBA student." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Sam Jaffe, Businessweek.com </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  argument  that  IBM  made  millions  from  its  association  with  the  Nazis  seems </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost impossible to refute." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—John Mark Eberhart, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  book  ...  is  an  ugly  story,  hidden  for  years,  told  by  a  master  craftsman  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">a compelling way. More than just another Holocaust tale . . . it's a chilling lesson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Richard Pachter, Miami Herald </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More  than  15  million  people  have  visited  the  Holocaust  Museum  and  seen  the  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  there.  Surely  some  have  raised  the  question:  How  could  this  prestigious  cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">poration  possibly  be  linked  to  such  a  heinous  stain  on  human  history?  With  empirical </p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence,  Edwin  Black  has  supplied  the  answer.  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  makes  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">empirical statement. Edwin Black has made his case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Louisville Courier-Journal </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This  damning  chronicle  of  IBM's  collusion  with  the  Nazis  exposes,  in  horrific  detail, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the corporation's opportunistic ride on Hitler's tail." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Charles Winecoff, Entertainment Weekly </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This  is  the  stuff  of  corporate  nightmare.  IBM,  one  of  the  world's  richest  companies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is  about  to  be  confronted  with  evidence  of  a  truly  shameful  history.  Edwin  Black </p>
<p class="calibre1">reveals Big Blue's vital role in the Holocaust." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Sunday Times, Great Britain </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black  ...  shows,  in  compelling  detail,  that  IBM,  'the  solutions  company'  was  also  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  of  the  Final  Solution....  It  is  a  distinctive  contribution  to  the  history  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">time.  It  wholly  justifies  Black's  years  of  toil. . .   a  terrible  warning  from  this  brilliantly </p>
<p class="calibre1">excavated past." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Peter Preston, The Guardian, Great Britain </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  computer  group  IBM  is  haunted  by  its  past.  Edwin  Black's  book  now  reveals </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company's  involvement  in  the  Holocaust.  .  .  .  Previously  the  Nazi  past  of  'Big </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blue'"  was  hardly  ever  a  topic.  .  .  .  But  now  IBM  is  in  the  dock.  Black's  meticulous </p>
<p class="calibre1">research  documents  just  how  precisely  IBM  managers  were  kept  informed  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">whereabouts of their machines." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Christian Habbe, Der Spiegel, Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  .  .  .  book  is  the  first  to  give  the  general  public  a  detailed  account  of  how  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  corporation  profited  from  intimate  ties  with  the  Nazis.  It  strips  the  veneer </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the cherished myth of the purity and patriotism of American business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Marilyn Henry, Jerusalem Post </p>
<p class="calibre1">"IBM  and  the  Holocaust  raises  startling  questions  about  the  technology  giant's  involve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  with  Nazi  government  officials—and  throws  the  company's  wartime  ethics  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">serious doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Jessica Reaves, Time.com </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black  .  .  .  documents  IBM's  sins  with  chilling  discipline....  IBM  and  the  Holocaust </p>
<p class="calibre1">lays  out  in  numbing  detail  the  terrible  deeds  of  bureaucrates  and  business  leaders.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  end,  thought  this  book  has  a  subtler  story  to  tell,  one  frighteningly  relevant  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">our  lives  today.  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  isn't  about  evil  men  at  a  particularly  bloody </p>
<p class="calibre1">point in recent history so much as it's about the dawn of the modern information age." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Douglas Perry, Fort Worth Star-Telegram </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Edwin Black has put together an impressive array of facts which result in a shocking </p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusion never realized before: IBM collaborated with the Third Reich. This book </p>
<p class="calibre1">should be read by everyone interested in the 'under history' of the Second World War." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Simon Wiesenthal, director, Jewish Documentation Center, Vienna </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Black's  great  contribution  is  that  he  has  tenaciously  collected  a  lot  of  information </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  combined  it  in  an  original  way.  Few  others  have  thought  to  place  this  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  in  the  same  context,  to  see  what  inferences  can  be  drawn.  Black's  history  makes </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  chilling  observations.  The  first  is  that  the  Holocaust  was  possible  because  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  had  access  not  only  to  guns  and  gas  but  also  to  cutting-edge  census  technol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ogy.  The  second  is  that  the  Nazis  had  access  to  this  technology  because  IBM,  in  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">paranoid  zeal,  worked  very  hard  to  maintain  its  market  dominance  of  the  global  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ket in data processing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Anthony Sebok, CNN.com </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A  shocking  account  of  IBM's  complicity  with  the  Nazis  is  a  reminder  that  people </p>
<p class="calibre1">bear  moral  responsibility  for  the  actions  of  the  corporation—a  point  that  critics  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">failed to grasp." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Jack Beatty, The Atlantic Online </p>
<p class="calibre1">"IBM  and  the  Holocaust  is  a  story  that  must  be  read  if  one  is  to  understand  how  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Nazis  were  able  to  implement  their  Final  Solution  to  exterminate  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry.... Once again, Edwin Black has hit the mark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Abraham H. Foxman, national director, Anti-Defamation League </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A  tremendous,  timely  work.  Neglected  for  more  than  50  years,  the  sordid  records </p>
<p class="calibre1">disclosing  IBM's  collaboration  with  the  Nazi  regime  have  now  been  exhumed  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edwin Black." </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Robert Wolfe, former chief National Archives expert for </p>

<p class="calibre1">—Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Edwin  Black's  groundbreaking  book,  IBM  and  the  Holocaust,  made  a  great  impres- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion  on  me.  It  documents,  for  the  first  time,  that  an  American  company,  IBM,  bears  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">good  deal  of  the  moral  responsibility  for  the  preparation  of  the  persecution  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  victims.  IBM  and  the  Holocaust  confirms  the  belief  that  the  Holocaust  was  not </p>
