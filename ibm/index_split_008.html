<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">10 THE  STRUGGLE  TO  STAY  IN  THE  AXIS </h3>

<p class="calibre1">DURING THE WINTER OF 1940-1941, AS CHAUNCEY NEGOTIATED </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Nazis  in  Germany,  war  enveloped  Europe.  While  Watson  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">executives </p>
<p class="calibre1">were </p>
<p class="calibre1">fighting </p>
<p class="calibre1">daily </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">retain </p>
<p class="calibre1">their </p>
<p class="calibre1">com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercial  primacy  in  the  Axis  conquest  machine,  millions  of  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  fighting  to  stay  alive  in  a  continent  overrun  with  highly  orga- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nized,  intensely  automated  Nazi  forces  and  their  surrogates.  News- </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper  articles,  dramatic  photos,  and  newsreels  continued  to  tell  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">tragic, even if by now familiar, story of Jewish destruction. November 9, 1940, </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York Times, "Reich Jews Sent to South France; 10,000 Reported Put Into </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camps."  At  Camp  de  Gurs,  the  refugees,  it  was  said,  were  forced  to  live  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">small wooden barracks without enough water and practically no food supply.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  26,  1940,  New  York  Times,  "Walls  Will  Enclose  War- </p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  Jews  Today;  500,000  Begin  'New  Life'  in  Nazi-Built  Ghetto."  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">Herman  decree,  all  Jews  in  Warsaw  have  been  required  to  take  up  resi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dence  in  the  ghetto  .  .  .  with  as  many  as  seven  persons  living  in  one  room </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  some  buildings.  The  wall—unusual  in  modern  times,  surrounds  100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">or more city blocks and closes off 2.00 streets and even street car lines.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  5,  1940,  New  York  Times,  "Rumania  Emerges  From </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Revolution';  Death  Toll  Nearly  400,  Wounded  Exceed  300—Terror </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reign  Lasted  for  Eight  Days."  Moldavian  Iron  Guard  "Purists"  launched </p>
<p class="calibre1">a pogrom of large proportions. Jews were kidnapped, beaten and killed at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Galati and Turnu Severinu, Giurgiu and Craieva... In daytime raids, Iron Guards </p>
<p class="calibre1">confiscated Jewish shops in Brasov, Timisoara and Ploesti.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  5,  1940,  New  York  Times,  "Cholera  Killing  Men  in  Concentra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion Camps in France." Refugees transferred from one camp to another. . . were </p>
<p class="calibre1">locked into cattle cars without food, water or sanitary equipment for as long as </p>
<p class="calibre1">four  days  at  a  time  .  .  .  nearly  all  of  the  15,000  inmates  were  stricken  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">cholera and approximately 500 died. "There were no shovels to dig graves with </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  no  coffins  to  bury  the  bodies  in,"  [an  imprisoned  doctor  said].  "We  dug </p>
<p class="calibre1">shallow graves with our hands and cremated those we could."4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  17,  1940,  New  York  Times,  "Property  of  Jews  in  Alsace  Is  Con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fiscated."  The  property  of  Jews  is  confiscated  and  will  be  distributed  either </p>
<p class="calibre1">gratis or at low prices. . . . The finer furnishings . . . have been sent to Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">by the trainload.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">January  14,  1941,  New  York  Times,  "Netherland  Jews  Must  Register."  All </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews must register within six weeks, under a decree issued today by the German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commissioner for the Netherlands.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">January  25,  1941,  New  York  Times,  "300  Jews  Reported  Slain."  Some  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  more  extreme  elements  of  the  insurgent  Iron  Guard  in  Bucharest </p>
<p class="calibre1">implemented  the  threat  to oust  the Jews  .  .  .  by  killing  an  estimated  300 Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">[that] they had herded into cellars and then turned machine guns on.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">January  26,  1941,  New  York  Times,  "Misery  and  Death  in  French  Camps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In some of the camps, . . . an "unbreathable atmosphere of human hopelessness" </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  reported,  with  "an  intense  desire  to  die"  attributed  to  most  of  the  older </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees.  [A  Gurs  camp  source  reported]  "They  will  not  fight  any  more; </p>
<p class="calibre1">apathetic, they lie on their straw mattresses, often refusing food and waiting for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the end."8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  all  the  atrocity  stories  being  broadcast,  "Watson  was  waging  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">own  struggle.  His  was  an  undying  determination  to  retain  IBM's  favored </p>
<p class="calibre1">dominance  in  the  Third  Reich's  commercial-industrial  complex.  The  struggle </p>
<p class="calibre1">was not going well. In the first week of January 1941, German Finance Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials  ruled  that  IBM's  setdement  with  Heidinger,  worth  almost  $900,000, </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  be  transacted  using  the  company's  blocked  Reichsmarks.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">frustration, Chauncey sent word to New York that he would "have to begin all </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  again."  One  of  the  main  government  objections  was  the  continuing </p>
<p class="calibre1">existence of IBM's so-called royalty program, which was considered a sham to </p>
<p class="calibre1">extract  profits  from  Germany  in  the  form  of  fake  expenses.  Why  else,  critics </p>
<p class="calibre1">complained, did IBM's own subsidiary pay the parent company royalties?9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  Party  circles  continued  to  demand  IBM  shed  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">majority ownership. IBM executives began to wonder if they might sell some </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares  to  the  Hitler  government  itself,  going  into  a  direct  partnership  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Reich,  "provided,  simultaneously,  official  formal  recognition  by  the  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment  .  .  .  [of]  the  validity  and  binding  nature  of  the  royalty  agreement." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  January  24,  1941,  a  Nazi  official  at  the  Deutsche  Bank  met  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  and  repeated  the  assertion  that  if  IBM  ceded  the  majority,  "we  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  care  of  any  new  competition."  New  York  did  not  mind  making  a  token </p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer  to  some  German  nationals,  but  Watson  still  hoped  he  would  not  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">forced to reduce IBM's ownership to a minority.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  very  end  of  January,  a  tired  Chauncey  was  hoping  to  return  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manhattan  to  make  his  confidential  report  in  the  security  of  IBM  headquar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ters.  Once  he  obtained  the  board's  decision,  he  would  fly  back  to  Berlin  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">again  confer  with  Veesenmayer  as  promised.  By  now,  Chauncey  had  learned </p>
<p class="calibre1">when  speaking  over  the  phone  to  refer  to  Veesenmayer  obliquely  as  "that </p>
<p class="calibre1">official" or "an official." Chauncey went to Geneva and phoned New York for </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  next  instructions.  The  conversation,  as  usual,  was  conducted  in  code  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">studded with cryptic allusions.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">JANUARY 31, 1941, 4:45 P.M. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey at IBM Geneva </p>
<p class="calibre1">John G. Phillips and Charles R. Ogsbury at IBM NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS: Hello, Harry, this is Phillips.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  Yes.  There  are  two  courses  open  to  me  at  the  moment.  I  shall </p>
<p class="calibre1">send  you  a  report  of  the  big  question  [retaining  the  majority],  which  I  can- </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  even  here  send  to  you  completely  in  all  respects,  over  the  telephone  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">written....  Or  I  could  come  back  to  the  United  States  and  give  you  a  writ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ten  report...  .  [But]  then  I  [must]  return  to  Germany  at  the  request  of  "an </p>
<p class="calibre1">official." </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS: You cannot define that any more? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  No,  but  you  can  understand.  Because  of the  time  that  may  be  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">volved,  I  promised  "that  official"  that  I  would  go  back  to  America  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">some degree of haste and return as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS: Does it need you, Harry, to complete it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  He  asked  me  to  do  that,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  I  had  left </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  our  lawyer  a  power  [of  attorney]  to  complete  whatever  we  may  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cide to do, because that man—our man [attorney Albert]—will have to go </p>
<p class="calibre1">into discussions... I am [now] going to read to you from a part of a letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  "our  best  friend,"  which  has  been  mailed  to  Mr.  Watson.  Quote:  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">introduction of influential industrial interests as new shareholders would </p>
<p class="calibre1">inure to the benefit of both IBM and Dehomag. Dissatisfaction has evi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dently  found  expression  in  criticism  of  t he   price,  and  other  policies—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  demands  for  the  creation  of  competition,  if  necessary,  by  Govern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mental initiative or at least with official support." End quote.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning  to  the  threat  of  a  Reich  cartel  effort  that  might  merge  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull and Dehomag, Chauncey suggested he try to stem the plan at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  The  transfer  of  the  interest  recently  acquired  in  the  French  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Company  [the  planned  German  cartel]  was  offered  for  the  majority </p>
<p class="calibre1">holding  in  Dehomag  .  .  .  which,  of  course,  would  not  be  to  our  advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You see that? I am going to attempt to get in touch with our French people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS:  I  have  a  question  here  on  that.  You  are  going  to  attempt  to  get  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">touch  with  our  French  People.  Now  Mr.  Ogsbury  has  made  some  notes </p>
<p class="calibre1">here  with  Mr.  Schotte  as  to  [three]  things  you  might  want  to  think  about: </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Bull  suit.  The  general  Bull  situation.  And  any  conversations  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">[IBM  French  subsidiary  director  Roger]  Virgile  and  Germany  in  connec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion with a merger and buying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OGSBURY: Harry, what will you do? Will you try to see Virgile in Paris or have </p>
<p class="calibre1">him go over there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  I  know  he  will  have  to  come  into  unoccupied  parts  [Vichy </p>
<p class="calibre1">France]. They [Nazi authorities] would not let us go to Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OGSBURY:  There  has  apparendy  been  some  negotiations  between  Virgile  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  with  respect  to  the  manufacture  of  parts  and  certain  machines.  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">think  you  will  find  all  that  correspondence  with  Taylor.  I  think  you  ought </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  get  acquainted  with  it  and  see  who  is  sponsoring  that.  It  looks  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">though  the  French  Company  [IBM's  subsidiary  in  Paris]  is  sponsoring  it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  it  certainly  is  being  done  without  the  consent  over  here.  See  what  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">mean?  That  ought  to  be  looked  into.  .  .  .  None  of  these  things  do  we  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cur in.... How long will you be there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  I  am  perfecdy  willing  to  stay  here.  While  I  want  to  be  in  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  I  am  perfecdy  willing  to  stay  here.  The  tiling  is  that  you  cannot  un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">derstand what it is [like] here [in Europe]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OGSBURY:  The  tiling  is  that  if  you  should  return  [to  New  York],  these  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">matters  can  all  wait.  You  see  what  I  mean?  These  things  that  I  am  talking </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  you  about  are  only  in  the  event  that  they  are  the  practical  thing  for  you  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">do, in view of how long you have to remain there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  I  will  have  to  be  here  [in  Geneva]  two  or  three  weeks  before  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  get  through  to  Lisbon  and  get  visas,  etc....  I  am  going  to  write  you  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">report as soon as I can.... I have sent word to Virgile. It may be necessary </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  us  to  go  to  Italy.  I  t h i n k   I  should  make  that  connection  down  there.  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">t h i n k  I b e t t e r  find out what it is all about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OGSBURY:  That  will  be  all  right,  if  it  isn't  going  to  interfere  with  the  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">things you ought to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS:  Harry,  the  thing  that  worries  me  this  afternoon  is  this.  Both  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  and  Mr.  Nichol  are  home  with  colds.  .  .  .  One  or  the  other  or  both </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  probably  be  back  on  Monday,  and  we  cannot  do  anything  over  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">weekend  anyway.  And  we  will  cable  you  and  talk  with  you  again  on  Mon- </p>
<p class="calibre1">day. How is that? ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: I am going over with Taylor everything that is open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PHILLIPS:  Harry,  can  you  answer  this  question?  Do  you  consider  that  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">should return and then go back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: I have given my promise that I shall return to "this official."13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURING  IBM'S  day-to-day  struggle  to  stay  in  the  Axis  during  wartime,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">firm  relied  on  the  cooperation  of  the  State  Department  to  act  as  postman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  message  relayed  through  an  American  Embassy  or  Legation  was  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  blindly  passed  on.  Multiple  copies  were  made  for  senior  staff  in  "Wash- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ington.  Periodically,  Watson  sent  letters  of  gratitude  for  the  on-going  help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  on  January  8,  1941,  Watson  mailed  Paul  T.  Culbertson,  Euro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pean Affairs division assistant chief: "I wish to thank you for the courtesy you </p>
<p class="calibre1">extended  our  company  in  connection  with  the  transfer  of  a  letter  to  me  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Harrison  K.  Chauncey,  representative  of  our  company,  who  is  temporar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ily  in  Berlin.  The  promptness  in  which  this  matter  was  handled  has  been  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">real  help  to  us  and  all  of  the  officers  of  our  company  join  me  in  expressing </p>
<p class="calibre1">our appreciation to you."14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Department's  desire  to  secretly  advance  the  commercial  causes  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  persevered  in  spite  of  the  nation's  officially  stated  opposition  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  menace.  For  this  reason,  it  was  vital  to  Watson  that  nothing  be  done  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">embarrass  or  even  annoy  the  Department  publicly.  This  caution  was  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">heightened  by  an  on-going  FBI  investigation  into  IBM's  operation  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">potential  hotbed  of  Nazi  sympathizers.  Avoiding  embarrassing  moments  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult  given  the  far-flung  global  empire  of  IBMers  so  deeply  involved  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fascist  and  Axis  countries,  and  accustomed  to  speaking  supportively  of  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">clients' military endeavors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter  G.  Ross,  affectionately  known  as  "Capt.  Ross,"  was  one  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  adventurous  and  freewheeling  European  agents  stationed  on  the  Conti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nent, triumphantly concluding important deals for the company. He was once </p>
<p class="calibre1">described by IBM as "one of the colorful ones," whose "zeal and dedication </p>
<p class="calibre1">.  .  .  [and]  exploits  would  be  recounted  for  decades.  Capt.  Ross  was  primarily </p>
<p class="calibre1">assigned  to  Fascist  Spain,  where  he  concentrated  on  the  Spanish  Railways.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940,  the  popular  Ross  was  ready  to  retire.  He  would  leave  behind  a  newly </p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  IBM  subsidiary  in  Spain  and  would  continue  on  as  a  special  advi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor. "When he came back to the United States in August 1940, the flamboyant </p>
<p class="calibre1">salesman  made  some  comments  to  a  local  newspaper,  the  Brooklyn  Eagle.15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those comments caused a furor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  his  candid  remarks,  Ross  predicted  that  England  would  be  forced  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  armistice  within  two  weeks,  thereby  abandoning  Europe.  Moreover,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">openly  revealed  his  approval  of  and  cooperation  with  the  Hitler  regime.  "He </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Ross]  ...  has  first-hand  knowledge,  having  lived  in  the  same  building  as  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  Minister  ...  On  reaching  these  shores,  the  Captain  was  'simply  terri- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied  and  appalled'  by  the  ultra-frank  outbursts  of  American  officials  against </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  and  Mussolini,  which,  he  opines,  were  in  the  manner  of  'spindly  boys </p>
<p class="calibre1">tweaking  the  neighborhood  bullies'  noses'...  'I  am  an  American,'  he  sums  up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'but  I  say  that  before  you  start  calling  names  be  sure  you're  prepared:  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">country  thinks  it's  going  to  spend  a  lot  of  money  and  make  soldiers  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">night.  You  can't  do  it.  Germany  worked  at  it  for  five  years'.  .  .  The  Germans, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  contends,  had  better  trained  soldiers,  superior  equipment  and  stream- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lined  generals."  Ross  also  declared  he  had  conceived  a  plan  in  which  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">could use his channels to funnel money to destitute civilians in Europe.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  seemingly  inconsequential  article  did  not  escape  the  attention  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">those in Washington on the lookout for Nazi sympathizers. Assistant Secretary </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  State  Adolf  Berle  sent  a  clipping  to  J.  Edgar  Hoover  at  the  FBI  declaring, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the  remarks  .  .  .  follow  the  same  pattern  used  in  all  German  propaganda." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copies  of  the  article  made  the  rounds  at  the  State  Department  and  IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly, Watson learned of the embarrassment. In an example of how Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if so moved, could act with swift corporate wrath to protect the company's in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">terest, Watson immediately turned on Ross. In an instant, Ross' decades of col- </p>
<p class="calibre1">orful accomplishments for IBM were forgotten. He was summarily cut off.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  6,  1940,  Watson  wrote  Ross  a  humiliating  termination </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter.  "I  have  before  me  a  clipping  from  the  Brooklyn  Eagle  of  August  28, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940,  in  which  you  pretend  to  speak  as  a  representative  of  our  Company," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  began.  "You  were  our  agent  working  on  a  commission  basis  in  Spain </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  several  years,  until  we  arranged  with  you  in  Paris,  in  August  1939,  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">your retirement.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  used  my  name  in  connection  with  a  plan  which  you  state  you  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">of sending monetary aid to refugees and destitute civilians in France, in which </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  say  I  am  willing  to  cooperate.  I  have  never  discussed  any  such  matter  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">you,  and  I  am  not  interested  in  any  plan  you  have  in  mind.  I  am  already  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tending my cooperation through oi l i er channels approved by our Government </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  have  no  right  to  involve  our  Company,  my  name,  or  any  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Company  representatives  in  any  statements.  Furthermore,  you  made  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  in  regard  to  the  countries  at  war,  and  criticized  our  country's  policies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  which  you  must  accept  sole  responsibilities  as  an  individual.  I  demand </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  you  inform  the  Brooklyn  Eagle  that  the  statement  attributed  to  you  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  expression  of  your  own  opinion  and  not  made  as  a  representative  of  Inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  Business  Machines  Corporation,  any  of  its  officers  or  members  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  organization;  and  that  your  statement  was  made  without  the  knowledge </p>
<p class="calibre1">or consent of anyone connected with our Company.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This  matter  is  so  serious  from  the  standpoint  of  our  Company  that  it  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary  to  advise  you  that  effective  immediately  we  must  sever  all  relations </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  us.  We  had  discussed  the  possibility  of  making  use  of  you  in  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  capacity  in  our  business,  but  the  statement  you  made  in  the  article </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred  to  makes  it  impossible  for  us  to  do  so.  I  am  attaching  to  this  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">the regular cancellation notice of your contract."18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  6,  1940,  Ross  indeed  wrote  the  editor  of  the  Brooklyn </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eagle  a  stultifying  retraction  that  sounded  as  though  it  had  been  typed  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  office.  The  typewriter  seemed  to  be  the  same  as  the  one  used  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  letter,  and  the  typist's  identifying  initials,  "LH,"  were  at  the  bottom </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  both  letters.  Moreover,  Ross'  retraction  used  the  nearly  identical  first  sen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tence  as  Watson's  letter  of  the  same  day.  "I  have  before  me  a  clipping  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Brooklyn  Daily  Eagle  of  August  28,  1940,"  Ross'  retraction  stated,  "which </p>
<p class="calibre1">purports  to  be  an  interview  with  one  of  your  reporters  at  your  office.  I  wish </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  correct  an  erroneous  impression  which  this  article  has  given  to  the  public. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  first  place,  I  am  not  a  representative  of  the  International  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines  Corporation  .  .  .  and  was  only  acting  in  an  advisory  capacity  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spain.  For  this  reason,  the  name  of  the  International  Business  Machines  Cor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">poration,  and  that  of  Mr.  Watson,  should  not  have  appeared  in  your  article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  I  said  to  your  reporter  was  my  own  personal  opinion,  and  I  did  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">speak  on  behalf  of  the  International  Business  Machines  Corporation,  or  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  its  officers.  I  wish  you  would  do  me  the  favor  of  publishing  this  letter  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">your paper at your earliest convenience."19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  same  September  6,  Watson  personally  dispatched  copies  of  Ross' </p>
<p class="calibre1">termination  and  his  retraction  to  a  number  of  senior  State  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">officials,  including  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull.20  When  the  dust  had  set- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tled on the brief but turbulent Ross episode, Watson had proved once again </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  when  he  wanted  in  control  the  people  in  his  organization,  he  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">mercilessly blunt and ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  instances,  some  IBMers  pushed  the  State  Department's  diplo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">matic  pouch  to  the  limits  of  propriety.  It  was  one  thing  to  help  an  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  protect  its  investment  in  Germany,  but  using  diplomatic  channels  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">deepen  IBM's  Nazi  relationships  in  occupied  countries  sometimes  made  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  recoil.  On  October  2,  1940,  IBM's  man  in  occupied  Denmark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max  Bodenhoff,  sent  Watson  a  letter  through  the  American  Legation  suggest- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  company  hire  a  personal  friend  of  German  Foreign  Minister  von </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ribbentrop  as  a  special  business  agent  to  further  the  subsidiary's  work  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Nazis  there.  America's  interim  charge  in  Copenhagen,  Mahlon  F.  Perkins, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was dubious about transmitting such a letter through official channels.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Max  Bodenhoff  .  .  .  represents  Mr.  Watson's  organization  in  Copen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">hagen,"  wrote the rankled charge  in  a  complaint sent  in  triplicate to  Washing- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ton.  "This  letter  is  not  transmitted  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  Diplomatic </p>
<p class="calibre1">Serials  3267  and  3268  of  August  9,  1940,  since  it  is  considered  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  should  decide  upon  the  propriety  of  transmitting  it.  It  will  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">noted that Mr. Bodenhoff suggests to Mr. Watson the employment of Dr. Orla </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arntzen,  who  is  a  close  friend  of  the  German  Foreign  Minister,  to  act  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  representative  of  the  International  Business  Machines  Corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  procedure  would  appear  to  involve  questions  of  policy  and  ethics  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Department may desire to consider."22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perkins'  objection  was  reviewed  by  no  fewer  than  eight  officials.  All </p>
<p class="calibre1">concurred  that  his  judgment  should  be  vindicated  by  sending  Bodenhoff's </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  back  to  Copenhagen  with  the  declaration:  "The  Department  does  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">believe  it  would  be  advisable  to  transmit  the  letter  mentioned  and  it  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">accordingly returned to the Legation."23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  one  point,  a  State  Department  officer  notified  IBM  NY:  "The  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  understands  that  commercial  telegraphic  facilities  are  available  between </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  United  States  and  Germany.  Should  you  experience  difficulty  in  commu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nicating  .  .  .  the  Department  will  be  pleased  to  consider  the  transmission  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  official  channels  at  your  expense  provided  you  supply  the  full  names </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  persons  or  firms  abroad  whose  interests  are  affected  thereby,  and  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">form  the  Department  as  to  the  nature  of  those  interests,  and  whether  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">persons  or firms  have American  nationality.  I  believe you  will readily  appreci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ate  that  the  Department,  especially  in  these  extraordinary  times,  must  reserve </p>
<p class="calibre1">its facilities for the service of legitimate American interests."24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  occasional  realization  that  the  State  Department  was  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming an all too indispensable player in the proliferation and protection of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  lucrative  relations  with  the  Nazis  in  Europe,  its  role  would  soon </p>
<p class="calibre1">exceed  the  realm  of  postman.  Soon,  diplomats  in  Berlin  would  become </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's special operatives in saving the company's niche in the Nazi Axis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY  RETURNED  to  Berlin  to  renew  his  excruciating  negotiations  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger.  Ironically,  as  the  United  States  edged  closer  to  entering  the  war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  believed  his  options  were  becoming  more  limited.  In  the  strange </p>
<p class="calibre1">praxis  of  German  law,  once  Dehomag  became  enemy  property,  the  subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  seized  by  a  receiver  and  all  ownership  frozen.  In  such  a  case,  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger's  hope  to  cash  out  would  also  be  frozen.  If  competition  supplanted </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM, his stock holdings could soon become worthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  early  March  1941,  Heidinger  agreed  to  a  new  setdement—RM  2.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million in exchange for giving up his preferential stockholder status. He would </p>
<p class="calibre1">still own his shares, and those shares could still be sold only to IBM upon his </p>
<p class="calibre1">departure from the company—but the price would be the book value.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  economic  bureaucrats  approved  because  the  transaction  wasn't </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  much  a  sale  as  a  reduction  in  status—and  Heidinger  was  handsomely </p>
<p class="calibre1">compensated for his various overdue bonuses.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Veesenmayer  was  still  insistent  that  IBM  relinquish  its  majority  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">face a newly created cartel. And now the cartel had a name: Wanderer-Werke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  old-line  German  motorcycle  and  toolmaker,  Wanderer-Werke,  was  being </p>
<p class="calibre1">primed  by  the  Reich  to  host  a  merger  of  French  Bull  and  Powers  interests, </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing  a  new  punch  card  enterprise  to  be  forged.  The  Powers  companies </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  now  controlled  by  Hermann  Goering  Works  under  an  overlapping  board </p>
<p class="calibre1">of directors. By now, Germany had realized that neither of the marginal firms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull  or  Powers,  possessed  the  necessary  production  capacity.  A  completely  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">German-owned  factory  would  be  needed.  Bull  schematics  and  blueprints </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  already  been  brought  to  Berlin  to  launch  a  new  machine  series  in  case </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  would  not  yield.  Germany  could  not  afford  an  immediate  separation </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  IBM  empire.  But  if  Watson  would  not  comply  voluntarily,  a  steady </p>
<p class="calibre1">combination  of  tactics  from  preferential  business  contracts  for  Wanderer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Werke  to  mandatory  price  reductions  at  Dehomag  would  compel  an  eventual </p>
<p class="calibre1">sell-out. This approach is what Veesenmayer considered "no pressure."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opinions  flagged  from  day  to  day  on  whether  the  Reich  could  proceed </p>
<p class="calibre1">without IBM. Even with a crash program to build new machines, it would take </p>
<p class="calibre1">months  before  the  first  machine  would  roll  off  assembly  lines.  Without  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">source  for  punch  cards,  it  would  be  like  producing  guns  without  bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understandably, Veesenmayer's pressure was carefully applied. If IBM with- </p>
<p class="calibre1">drew  and  suddenly  stopped  servicing  the  Reich,  Nazi  automation  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon rattle to a halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  are  threatened  with  possible  elimination  of  Dehomag  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">competition,"  Chauncey  reported  to  New  York  on  March  10,  1941,  "which </p>
<p class="calibre1">may  be  sponsored  by  the  authorities.  We  are  also  threatened  with  attack  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  royalty  agreement;  and  further  threatened  with  a  substantial  reduction  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">prices if we do not give up the majority."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  could  only  repeat,  "Dr.  Veesenmayer  .  .  .  stated  that  no  pres- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  [would]  be  brought  to  bear  to  surrender  the  majority  but  that  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">advisable  to  do  so.  He  told  me  all  that  was  wanted  was  a  friendly  agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  I  asked  Dr.  Veesenmayer  for  some  assurance  of  protection  for  our  minority </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  event  we  relinquished  the  majority.  He  replied  .  .  .  there  could  not  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">any writing of assurance."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  pretense  that  Dehomag's  management  was  still  a  group  of" </p>
<p class="calibre1">independent-minded  employees  or  executives.  They  were  openly  pawns  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Nazi  Party.  "Mr.  Heidinger  and  several  other  members  of  the  board  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi members," stressed Chauncey. "As nearly as I can learn, they have to fol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">low any order issued by the Nazi Party."30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  a  rebellious  Chauncey  still  clung  to  his  revulsion  over  what  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  "blackmail  threats."  Giving  up  the  majority  would  not  protect  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany's investment, he argued. "Upon giving up the majority," he asserted, "we </p>
<p class="calibre1">can  obtain  no  assurance  that  the  next  attack  would  not  be  against  the  [re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">maining  IBM]  minority  and  even  against  the  payment  of  royalties."  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  termed  the  German  unhappiness  as  mere  "growling."  It  was  easy  to  talk </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  starting  a  new  cartel.  The  reality  was  unchanged:  "The  government  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  present  time  needs  our  machines.  The  army  is  using  them  presendy  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">every conceivable purpose."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  while  IBM  came  to  believe  they  could  not  be  dislodged  from  the  Axis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  did  fear  the  diminishment  of  profit  that  any  attempted  competition, </p>
<p class="calibre1">howsoever  tenuous  or  distant,  might  pose.  The  man  who  would  not  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">tolerate  competition  from  used  cash  registers  would  now  only  intensify </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  effort  to  block  competition  from  diluting  IBM  profits.  Ironically,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">diligence  of  IBM  auditors  to  certify  and  report  that  profit  never  paused  dur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  entire  Dehomag  Revolt.  Even  as  Watson  expended  maximum  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sources  to  protect  his  monopoly,  the  accountants  were  busy  double-checking </p>
<p class="calibre1">every penny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  Dehomag  invoice  to  every  client  for  every  machine  and  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  was  reviewed  by  IBM  Geneva  for  correctness  and  then  verified  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">financial supervisors in New York. This fiscal procedure applied to both </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  billing  within  Germany  and  in  the  conquered  n a t i o n s   and </p>
<p class="calibre1">territor i e s  </p>
<p class="calibre1">o f  </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  Dehomag  generated  four  small  invoices  in  spring  1940.  In- </p>
<p class="calibre1">voice  #04/26469  billed  March  13,  1940;  invoices  #04/28499  and  #04/28500 </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  billed  May  21;  and  invoice  #04/28612  billed  May  27,  1940.  These  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">voices  were  missing  from  Dehomag's  periodic  submissions.  To  track  them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York accountants made a written request to Geneva on December 23, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1940.  Taylor  in  Geneva  issued  a  detailed  two-page  single-spaced  item-by- </p>
<p class="calibre1">item  response  on  February  14,  1941,  with  a  simultaneous  written  request  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag in Berlin to resubmit the invoices in duplicate. On February 26, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941,  Dehomag  accountants  sent  a  letter  in  German  to  Geneva  confirming </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  a  new  reconciliation  statement  would  be  sent  out;  a  translation  into  Eng- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lish  was  forwarded  to  New  York.  The  four  invoices  were  ultimately  tracked: </p>
<p class="calibre1">one was for $525.60, a second was for $46.77, a third was for $23.44, and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">fourth was for $1.52.33 At IBM, every penny counted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  on  March  12,  1941,  Germany's  cracking  wartime  economy  put  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  greater  strain  on  the  flow  of  money  from  Dehomag.  Reich  Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minister  Walther  Funk  warned  at  the  annual  Reichsbank  stockholders  lunch- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eon  that  "drastic  restrictions"  on  corporate  profits  would  soon  be  announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dividends in excess of 6 percent would be subjected to "prohibitive taxation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only way to correct reduced profits was a voluntary increase in capitaliza- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  permissible  during  a  brief  investment  window;  6  percent  of  the  higher </p>
<p class="calibre1">capital  investment  would  of  course  yield  greater  profit  sums.  In  other  words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  those  who  further  invested  in  the  German  economy  could  continue  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">reap significant profits. Funk's words sent off alarm bells throughout IBM.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  bells  sounded  when,  in  late  May  1941,  IBM  realized  that  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">was cutting prices to support the German war effort without IBM's permission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MEMORANDUM TO THOMAS J. WATSON </p>
<p class="calibre1">From: J. C. Milner </p>
<p class="calibre1">Subject: German Rental Prices </p>
<p class="calibre1">May 23, 1941 </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  have  heard  from  the  Geneva  office  that  the  German  Company  have  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced  their  rental  prices  to  customers  by  approximately  ten  percent.  This  will </p>
<p class="calibre1">naturally  mean  that  our  royalties  will  be  affected  in  the  same  proportion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  we  have  no  recent  figures  from  Germany,  we  would  estimate  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ten  percent  reduction  would  mean  a  reduction  of  approximately  1,500,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichsmarks in the gross annual rentals of the German Company.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  June  12,  1941  the  Reich  i ssued  its  profil  restricting  regulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  profit  li mi t s  affected  not  only  I B M ,   but  profit  bonuses  for  Heidinger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke, and  Hummel as  well. The  German  managers knew that if  IBM did  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  its  investment,  bonuses  would  not  be  possible.  A  loophole  in  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">law,  however,  allowed  the  board  of  directors—with  or  without  majority </p>
<p class="calibre1">approval—to  reinvest  its  funds  in  the  company.  Dehomag  had  accrued  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions  of  blocked  Reichsmarks  in  undistributed  profits  waiting  to  be  allocated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Nazi  board  could  vote  to  reinvest  that  money,  thus  increasing  the  stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  company.  More  stock  meant  more  shares.  Under  German  law,  when  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  increased  its  shares  with  new  investment,  the  new  shares  were  allo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cated  in  the  identical  proportions  as  the  existing  ownership.  In  other  words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  percentages  would  remain  the  same—just  everyone  would  own  more— </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  in  any  stock  split.  These  new  shares  would  be  distributed  without  taxes.36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  and  company  decided  they  would  rush  a  vote  through  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">double  the  capital  of  the  company,  from  about  RM  7.7  million  to  about  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">15  million,  using  IBM's  blocked  profits.  They  would  force  a  vote  with  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">without  IBM  precisely  because  the  law  allowed  directors  to  vote  reinvest- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment without shareholder consent.37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  more  was  at  stake  for  IBM  than  just  reinvesting  its  profits  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag.  Up  until  now,  although  IBM  retained  about  85  percent  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares,  the  15  percent  owned  by  Heidinger,  Rottke,  and  Hummel  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">restricted  shares.  Unlike  most  stock  holdings,  Dehomag  shares  could  not  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">routinely  sold,  collateralized,  or  transferred  like  ordinary  shares  in  any  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany.  The  shares  were  owned  only  so  long  as  the  three  managers  remained </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  company  and  could  not  be  sold  to  anyone  other  than  IBM.  More- </p>
<p class="calibre1">over,  each  man  had  obtained  the  shares  not  by  an  ordinary  purchase  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  a  large  paper  loan  from  IBM  that  was  canceled  when  the  loans  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">"given  back."  In  essence,  the  three  German  managers  owned  captive  stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Watson controlled.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  Dehomag's  total  stock  doubled  to  RM  15  million,  the  new  shares </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  distributed  85  percent  to  IBM  and  15  percent  to  the  Germans— </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  one  extraordinary  difference.  Fifteen  percent  of  the  new  shares  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">proportionately  flow  to  the  three  Germans  automatically.  Restrictive  covenants </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  not  apply  to  the  new  shares.  Heidinger,  Rottke,  and  Hummel  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">sell  or  trade  their  shares  to  anyone,  including  the  new  cartel.  And  the  shares </p>
<p class="calibre1">would be distributed free—no loans, no payments.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matters  began  coming  to  a  head  when  the  Dehomag  requested  that  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">additional  profit  should  be  declared  so  bonuses  could  be  paid.  IBM  took  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">hard line. On August 27, 1941, Schotte, who was now permanently headquar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tered New York cabled Geneva:    "Re: Dehomag.  No dividends to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared."  IBM  Europe  Manager  W.  C.  Lier  was  about  to  dictate  a  letter  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  advising  as  much  when  distressing  correspondence  arrived  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert  in  Berlin.  Albert  warned  that  the  German  board's  true  intentions  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  just  to  declare  profits,  but  to  double  the  stock  from  blocked  funds  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">distribute shares before any restrictive covenants could be imposed.40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lier shelved his letter to Dehomag. Instead he cabled IBM NY: "Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">confidentially  advises:  Dehomag  preparing  another  meeting  which  may </p>
<p class="calibre1">decide  without  IBM  represented.  According  Albert,  Dehomag  planning </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  capital  to  such  extent  as  to  get  [shares]  out  of  IBM  control..  ..  Kiep </p>
<p class="calibre1">not sufficient since can be outvoted."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  understood  that  IBM  would  be  compelled  to  vote  in  favor  of—or </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  precisely,  authorize—the  stock  split.  There  were  so  many  reasons.  First, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was the only way to extract a hefty 12 percent dividend from revenues and </p>
<p class="calibre1">corcumvent  the  Reich's  new  profit  restriction.  New  York  wanted  that.  More- </p>
<p class="calibre1">over,  Albert  knew  IBM  could  not  control  the  numerical  vote  of  the  board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vote to split would prevail in any event. But New York could not allow a </p>
<p class="calibre1">vote  to  be  taken  without  IBM's  consent  or  involvement—even  if  that  consent </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  pressured  or  begrudged.  Such  a  precedent  would  lead  to  unending </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  decisions  without  IBM's  involvement.  First  it  would  be  Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  Dehomag  would  maneuver  the  other  European  subsidiaries.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">would not permit it.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  all,  if  IBM  voted  against  reinvestment  in  Germany  at  this  crucial </p>
<p class="calibre1">stage  in  the  negotiations  with  the  Nazi  Party  it  would  only  reinforce  the  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ception that Watson was unfriendly to the Third Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert  urged  IBM  to  be  represented  at  the  meeting,  which  seemed  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">planned  for  mid-September,  and  unequivocally  vote  its  majority  in  favor  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the stock split. If nothing else, IBM could cooperate in the stock split on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">condition  that  the  new  shares  distributed  to  Germans  were  brought  under </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  same  restrictive  agreements  as  the  prior  shares.  However,  to  appear  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM,  Albert  needed  a  proxy.  Chauncey  had  foreseen  such  an  emergency  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore  he left  Germany  in  the  spring.  He left a  formal proxy  in the  custody  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">t hi r d party, a secret source he could trust to follow his explicit instructions— </p>
<p class="calibre1">a source in Berlin, one who was beyond the reach of the Nazis.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert physically needed the sequestered proxy in hand so he could </p>
<p class="calibre1">display it at the board meeting. August 29, late in the day, Lier cabled NY: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Albert stating third party holding IBM proxy for him. Desirable proxy handed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to him.... Albert states imperative he obtain proxy in order [to] protect IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">interests. Suggests you cable third party hand him proxy. Also suggests we </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable  Dehomag  Albert  our  attorney  who  should  be  invited  all  meetings  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">participate all Dehomag affairs. Albert urging speedy decision. Please advise."44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was morning in New York when Chauncey received Lier's emergency </p>
<p class="calibre1">dispatch  from  Geneva.  He  responded  before  the  end  of  the  day,  Friday, </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  29,  instructing  his  secret  source  in  Berlin.  The  source  did  not  receive </p>
<p class="calibre1">the cable until the next Wednesday, September 3.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">SEPTEMBER 3, 1941 </p>

<p class="calibre1">New York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Chauncey: </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your  cable  of  August  29  requesting  me  to  turn  over  the  power  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney  to  Dr.  Albert  has  been  received  and  your  instructions  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">carried  out  this  morning  when  I  personally  handed  him  the  document </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  question  and  gave  him  your  message.  He  assured  me  that  your  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">structions  would  be  carried  out  to  the  letter.  If  developments  do  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">move  smoothly,  there  is  a  possibility  that  I  shall  call  you  on  the  tele- </p>
<p class="calibre1">phone  or  write  you  in  detail  as  Dr.  Albert  advises.  Briefly  he  stated  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Heidinger  was  attempting  to  take  advantage  of  the  dividend  limita- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  decree,  which  was  issued  since  you  left  Germany,  to  force  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">issuance of new stock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  you  left  here  I  thought  we  would  see  each  other  in  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  this  time,  but  as  events  are  moving  so  slowly  I  have  settled </p>
<p class="calibre1">down  for  the  winter.  Paul  Pearson,  whom  you  will  remember,  is  sched- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uled  for  home  leave  and  may  be  passing  through  New  York  next </p>
<p class="calibre1">month.  There  is  a  possibility  that  he  will  bring  you  a  message  if  devel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">opments  between  now  and  then  justify  such  action.  Please  remember </p>
<p class="calibre1">me to Mr. Watson and Mr. Nichol, and with all good wishes to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely Yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam E. Woods </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commercial Attache </p>
<p class="calibre1">United States Embassy </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  five  Germans  now  sat  on  the  Dehomag  board,  few  of  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">could appear in Berlin for the rush meeting Heidinger planned for Sep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tember  19  -  even  Heidinger  himself.  Heidinger  lived  in  Munich.  So  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schulte-S t r a t h aus.  Dr.  Vogt,  Heidinger's  brother-in-law,  lived  in  Berlin  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">was in poor health,  and   not  available on  such  short  notice. Arrangements </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  made  for  all  three  unavailable  directors  to  sign  proxies.  Each  signed </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  September  16  proxy  forms  prepared  by  Hans  Mahr,  a  Dehomag  attor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ney.  These  proxies  empowered  either  Kiep  or  Ziegler  to  vote  per  specified </p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions—to generate a stock split. Kiep was loyal to "Watson, but the for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mer  German  consul  in  New  York  was  still  an  official  of  the  German  Foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry. The pressure on him was immense. He would have no choice but to </p>
<p class="calibre1">vote  as  instructed  on  the  proxy  by  Heidinger  and  his  clique.  There  was  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">chance Kiep  could cast  his  personal  vote against  reinvestment  in  Germany,  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">he </p>
<p class="calibre1">would </p>
<p class="calibre1">have </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">join </p>
<p class="calibre1">with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">majority.47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert was holding IBM's proxy, conveyed by Woods, but no instruc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions from Watson. The new German law did not require profit taking; it only </p>
<p class="calibre1">offered  corporations  a  window  to  double  their  dividends  on  the  condition </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  more  money  was  reinvested  in  the  Reich.  But  IBM  would  have  to  vote </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  stock  split  for  a  host  of  reasons—that  seemed  clear.  Albert  needed  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">decision—fast.  If  IBM  was  isolated by  its  own  board,  and  voted  against  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  economic  support,  it  would  only  seal  the  view  that  IBM  was  an  enemy </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Hitler regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,  at  a  time  when  America  was  closer  than  ever  to  entering  the  war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  was  profoundly  uncertain  how  doubling  the  investment  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived.  If  it  could  appear  that  the  investment  was  somehow  compulsory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  IBM  could  simply  explain  it  was  required  to  comply  with  the  law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woods  could  not  provide  such  a  statement,  since  the  law  was  clearly </p>
<p class="calibre1">optional. But he was willing to read such a statement from Albert to IBM NY, </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing  IBM  to  transcribe  the  conversation  and  in  so  doing  create  a  record </p>
<p class="calibre1">of what appeared to be government coercion. A phone call was arranged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SEPTEMBER 17, 1941, 10 A.M. NEW YORK TIME </p>
<p class="calibre1">WATSON: Hello, Mr. Woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS:  Hello,  Mr.  Watson.  I  am  going  to  read  a  message  to  you  from  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney. This is the message: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As  you  know,  a  special  law,  enacted  June  12,  1941,  provides  that  the  divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dends  of  any  and  all  companies  organized  under  German  law  are  from  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  restricted  to  six  percent.  .  .  .  they  can,  according  to  certain  detailed  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scriptions,  increase  their  share  capital  out  of  their  surplus.  This  is  to  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">done by the board of directors, not by general [shareholder] meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag intends to increase their share capital out of surplus by 100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">percent—RM 15,400,000—and will then be entitled to declare six per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent  dividends  on  the  15,400,000    Marks    which  is  equivalent  to  12  percent </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  original  7,700,000.  The  obvious  advantages  of  this  are  .  .  .  transfer  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">surplus  .  .  .  without  shareholders  paying  well-known  high  taxes.  .  .  .  This </p>
<p class="calibre1">law  can  practically  be  considered  compulsory.  (In  other  words,  it  is  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulsory  that  this  be  done).  . . .   I  strongly  recommend  you  send  a  cable  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">approval." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  message  was  transcribed  as  coming  from  Woods  and  therefore  was  en- </p>
<p class="calibre1">veloped in the authority of the commercial attache.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joining  Watson  in  the  conference  call  were  Nichol  and  Chauncey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woods was actually excited to speak to Watson himself. Indeed, Woods imme- </p>
<p class="calibre1">diately  had  Albert's  message  typed  into  a  letter  to  IBM  NY,  adding,  "It  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">good  to  hear  your  voices  and  I  am  looking  forward  eagerly  to  seeing  you </p>
<p class="calibre1">when I pass through New York the next time I am at home."49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  conversation  with  Woods,  Watson  told  the  attache  he  agreed  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">principle  to  the  stock  split,  provided  the  Germans  restricted  their  new  stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">as well. But IBM could not yet formally authorize it. Why? General Ruling 11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">made  it  against  the  law.50  Complying  with  General  Ruling  11  would  take </p>
<p class="calibre1">time. Time was something Watson did not have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  America  advanced  toward  the  moment  it  would  enter  the  war,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt  Administration  had  recendy  espoused  General  Ruling  11,  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">emergency  regulation  forbidding  any  financial  transactions  with  Nazi  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  without  a  special  Treasury  Department  license  involving  written  justifi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cations.  Even  certain  corporate  instructions  of  a  financial  nature  were  subject </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  rule.  This  was  something  completely  new  to  contend  with  in  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  alliance.  IBM  would  now  be  required  to  seek  a  complicated,  bureau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cratic  approval  for  each  financial  instruction  it  ordered  for  its  overseas  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries  under  Nazi  control.  General  Ruling  11  would  not  affect  subsidiaries </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  neutral  countries,  such  as  Sweden  or  Switzerland.  Even  still,  it  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">severely  hamper  all  communications  with  Dehomag  itself,  and  open  a  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment window into many of IBM's complex transactions.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">How much time did IBM have? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The board meeting was scheduled in Berlin for late the next day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  York  immediately  cabled  Woods  that  it  approved  Albert's  recom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mendation  to  double  the  investment  to  RM  15.4  million—an  increased  rein- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vestment of about $2 million extra. But there was a condition. The new stock </p>
<p class="calibre1">issued to the three Germans must be restricted under the existing captive </p>
<p class="calibre1">share agreements. That was imperative.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  IBM  people  had  to  complete  the  two-page  sworn  affidavit </p>
<p class="calibre1">application  to  authorize  the  doubling  of  stock.  It  needed  to  be  signed  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation's  secretary-treasurer,  John  G.  Phillips.  But  he  was  not  available. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  time  to  waste.  Someone  signed  Phillips'  name  to  both  lines  where  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">required,  and  then  dutifully  placed  their  cursive  lowercase  initials—aer— </p>
<p class="calibre1">under the signature to show it was affixed by a person designated to sign.53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Phillips'  signature  had  to  be  executed  and  certified  in  the  presence  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  notary.  No  problem.  Someone  found  a  notary  in  Queens.  He  verified  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">signatures  as  genuine,  stamped  his  name  and  commission  number  just  be- </p>
<p class="calibre1">neath  the  Phillips  signature,  and  then  pressed  his  embossing  seal  onto  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">application.  A  short  transcript  of  Woods'  telephone  conversation  with  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  attached  to  prove  the  urgency  of  the  transaction.  The  carefully  quoted </p>
<p class="calibre1">dialogue  fragment  included  Albert's  well-structured  explanation  that  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  really  an  optional  profit-taking  regulation  "can  practically  be  considered </p>
<p class="calibre1">compulsory."54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  application  clearly  stated  that  it  could  only  be  presented  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Federal  Reserve  Bank  in  Manhattan.  But  by  the  time  the  application  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">signed  and sealed, it  was just too  late. The  Federal  Reserve  was closed.  Deal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  with  the  phlegmatic  Fed  would  be  too  slow  anyway.  Chauncey  headed  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington  D.C.  He  would  go  over  the  head  of  the  Fed,  right  to  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  morning,  September  19,  Chauncey  appeared  at  the  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department.  The  Dehomag  board  meeting  would  soon  get  under  way—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  would  not  be there  to  vote for reinvestment  unless the license  was issued </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  once.  Clearly  agitated  and  pressured,  Chauncey  demanded  the  review </p>
<p class="calibre1">officer issue the license to authorize the stock split.56 When? Right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Mr.  Rueffer,  the  review  officer  at  Treasury,  was  in  no  real  hurry.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucratically  informed  Chauncey  that  such  an  application  would  take </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  time  and  must  first  be  submitted  through  proper  channels—namely </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  in  New  York.  An  impatient  Chauncey  now  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">riled. This  application  was  too  important,  it  could  not  wait.  He  insisted  that  if </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Treasury  license  was  not  rendered  at  once,  IBM's  German  affiliate  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">take its own action in what was "probably a matter of compulsion."57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rueffer  was  not  fazed.58  The  matter  just  could  not  be  done  quickly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take it to New York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, in Berlin, a Dehomag attorney, Hans Mahr, had been called </p>
<p class="calibre1">to certify the proper form of the board meeting. The session would be held </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  at  Dehomag's  headquarters,  where  a  last-minute  cable  from  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  received,  but  at  the  Hotel  Adlon—Watson's  favorite.  Kiep  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ziegler  would  be  there  to  vote  their  proxies  as  instructed  by  Heidinger.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting would convene soon—at 5 P.M.59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back  in  Washington,  Chauncey  could  not  wait.  He  demanded  to  see </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assistant Secretary J. W. Pehle for faster action. That was not possible.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then could he meet with a senior member of the staff?61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  of  Mr.  Rueffer's  supervisors  agreed  to  meet  Chauncey.  But  the  real- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity  that  the  application  would  have  to  creep  through  the  slow  channels  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Federal  Reserve  Bank  was  sinking  in.  In  frustration  and  futility,  Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">laid  out  the  financial  transaction  to  the  supervisor.  Surplus  money  blocked  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  RM  7.7  million,  would  be  reinvested  in  the  company,  doubling  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">capital  of  Dehomag.  He  stressed  that  even  though  IBM  NY  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  to  approve  the  recapitalization,  no  funds  would  be  transferred  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  U.S.  In  fact,  the  transaction  would  still  leave  an  additional  surplus  of  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">10 million.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  added  that  he  had  just  been  to  Germany,  and  then  his  story </p>
<p class="calibre1">began  to  wend  into  all  sorts  of  permutations.  The  Treasury  supervisor </p>
<p class="calibre1">recalled  that  Chauncey  "claims  that  unless  the  proposed  change  is  made,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  authorities  will  make  the  change  themselves  .  .  .  German  interests </p>
<p class="calibre1">will acquire control of the company."63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  truth,  when  the  stock  split  was  ratified,  the  proportion  of  ownership </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  remain  identical.  The  three  Germans  would  still  own  the  same  15  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent.  The  government  would  not  effectuate  the  split;  that  was  strictly  a  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness  decision  for  Dehomag's  board.  The  Treasury  supervisor  remained </p>
<p class="calibre1">unconvinced.  He  noted,  "His  [Chauncey's]  explanation  of  this  was  somewhat </p>
<p class="calibre1">vague  and  had  to  do  with  present  German  laws  about  which  he  was  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain."64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  was  again  told  by  the  supervisor  that  Rueffer  was  correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  law,  IBM  needed  to  provide  a  proper  detailed  explanation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock  split  and  file  that  with  the  license  application  at  the  Federal  Reserve </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bank.  Knowing  that  time  was  running  out  for  some  sort  of  instruction  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin,  Chauncey  pressed  the  supervisor  for  at  least  an  opinion.  Might  such  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction  be  approved?  It  was  all  speculation.  The  supervisor  just  could  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">predict.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  was  "extremely  urgent,"  insisted  Chauncey.  It  didn't  matter.  Noth- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing he said that day could make the license happen.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time was running out. The vote was about to proceed, and Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed to authorize the vote. But Watson could not authorize it. Chauncey </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  authorize  it.  No  one  at  IBM  NY  would  authorize  it  without  a  Trea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sury license. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  Sam  Woods  authorized  it.  He  called  Albert  and  told  him  to  proceed.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert informed Dehomag officials that IBM NY was authorizing the </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock split and would not challenge the reinvestment. In a brief corporate </p>
<p class="calibre1">event,  Kiep  and  Ziegler  assembled  at  Berlin's  Hotel  Adlon  at  5  P.M.  Kiep </p>
<p class="calibre1">officially  opened  the  meeting  and  stated  the  sole  agenda  item.  He  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ziaegler verbally agreed in the presence of attorney Mahr, who certified every </p>
<p class="calibre1">procedural step of the two men. The stock was split.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  must  have  been  furious.  For  decades,  IBM  had  tiptoed  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  serpentine  regulations  of  seventy  countries—whether  at  war,  in  peace,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">anything  in  between.  From  Fascist  states  to  revolutionary  regimes,  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  had  always  managed  to  avoid  legal  infractions  of  any  kind.  Now  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared  that  General  Ruling  11  had  been  violated.  General  Ruling  11  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">essentially  a  precursor  to  Trading  with  the  Enemy  regulations.  It  was  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  important.  Moreover,  Chauncey's  name  was  on  the  proxy  that  effected </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  transaction.  Everyone  began  explaining  themselves  in  carefully  worded </p>
<p class="calibre1">memos and letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert wrote to Chauncey on October 9, "It is true that Mr. Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">stated  he  would  send  me  a  cable  immediately  authorizing  such  procedure </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  that  I  have  not  received  such  a  cable;  on  the  contrary,  I  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">informed  that  this  cable  .  .  .  could  not  be  sent  due  to  the  fact  that  IBM  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  yet  received  license  from  Treasury  Department.  ...  I  have  not  waited  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  had  informed  the  Dehomag  .  .  .  that  they  were  authorized  to  go  ahead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  so  doing,  Albert  added,  he  was  able  to  show  IBM's  willingness  to  cooper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ate  in  the  German  economy.  In  consequence,  "everything  had  been  amicably </p>
<p class="calibre1">settled,"  he  continued,  which  allowed  more  objectionable  decisions  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">board to be avoided. "I took the responsibility of approval upon myself."69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding  that  Chauncey  might  have  to  answer  to  the  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  Albert's  apologia  went  on,  "I  hope  you  do  not  get  into  difficul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties  with  your  [Treasury]  Department.  They  will  certainly  understand....  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious  reasons,  I  am  not  sending  any  more  particulars  than  are  already  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's hands."70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  same  day,  October  9,  IBM's  Werner  Lier  wrote  a  formal  four-page </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  to  Watson  explaining  events.  He  had  gone  over  the  complete  file  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert's  office.  "I  noted  therefrom  the  decision  taken  by  Dr.  Albert,  upon </p>
<p class="calibre1">advice  of  Mr.  Woods,  to  increase  the  capital  by  100  percent....  [But]  we  wish </p>
<p class="calibre1">to remind you in this connection of Mr. Woods' telephone call . . . and from </p>
<p class="calibre1">which he deducted [sic] your agreement." Lier declared the urgent move was </p>
<p class="calibre1">required "to avoid a precedent of Dehomag overstepping the prerogatives of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the IBM."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  couldn't  be  sure  what  to  do.  Its   license  application  was  slowly  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">colating  through  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  the  Treasury  Department.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">series  of  formal  letters  and  cables  began  papering  the  files  reflecting  official </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  non-authorization.  On  September  26,  a  week  after  the  stock  was  split, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  cabled  Woods  at  the Embassy:  "Regret  we  have  not  been  able  [to]  cable </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  in  response  your  telephone  message  due  to  [the]  fact  that  we  have  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet received license from Treasury."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Embassy  was  surely  confused  because  shortly  thereafter  it  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  a  message  for  clarification.  A  week  later,  Chauncey  replied  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy,  "Re:  your  cable  of  September  29,  representative  may  not  act  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">absence of license ... and permission requested therefore is denied."73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">General  Ruling  11  would  make  it  impossible  for  IBM  to  continue  doing </p>
<p class="calibre1">business  in  the  freewheeling  cross-border  fashion  it  was  accustomed  to.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  could  not  wait  weeks  for  every  instruction  to  be  approved  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Treasury  Department.  Indeed,  just  after  Dehomag  doubled  the  capitalization, </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  of  Watson's  confidants  were  to  meet  with  Lier  from  IBM  Geneva, </p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly  to  discuss  how  to  deploy  the  additional  investment.  That  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  further  the  appearance  of  IBM  ratification.  On  September  22,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy  cabled  Chauncey  one  of  many  cryptic  messages:  "Your  two  friends </p>
<p class="calibre1">wish Swiss representative to meet Dehomag people. Do you agree?"74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  tried  to  stop  Lier  from  traveling  from  IBM  Geneva  to  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many.  An  immediate  cable  was  sent to the  Geneva  office.  But  it  was too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The office replied, "Already en route. Left Saturday morning. Tried reach him </p>
<p class="calibre1">border  without  success.  .  .  .  Only  Bachofen  [Lier's  assistant]  can  reach  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">safe  discreet  way."  Lier  arrived  in  Berlin  anyway  and  began  working  on  vital </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  projects  such  as  moving  Dehomag  machines  from  Poland  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romania where they were urgendy needed for a census.75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  9,  1941,  Milner  in  the  New  York  office  sent  a  memorandum </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Chauncey  regarding  "Shipment  of  Dehomag  Machines  to  Various  Coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries."  Milner  worried  that  it  might  have  become  too  difficult  to  continue </p>
<p class="calibre1">business as usual with the Hitler regime. "As you  know, on June 15, 1941 we </p>
<p class="calibre1">cabled  the  Geneva  office  regarding  the  President's  [Franklin  D.  Roosevelt's] </p>
<p class="calibre1">proclamation,  and  instructed  them  not  to  make  any  move  involving  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">assets  without  securing  advice  from  the  American  Consulate.  This  was  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid  their  unintentionally  violating  any  provision  of  the  President's  decree.  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">am wondering whether you would deem it advisable to definitely instruct </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva that none of the European countries which can be controlled should </p>
<p class="calibre1">order any goods from Dehomag. T his, of course, is a serious step, as some of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  countries  are  using  Dehomag  machines  and  currently  require  repair </p>
<p class="calibre1">parts. It might be well for us to discuss this subject at your convenience."76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  would  not  place  a  stop  on  any  of  its  Dehomag  business,  or  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary's  interaction  with  it.  IBM  filed  another  request  with  the  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department,  this  time  to  send  an  instruction  to  all  of  its  European  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiaries  and  agencies,  as  well,  as  its  divisions  in  Japan.  The  instruction:  "In </p>
<p class="calibre1">view  of  world  conditions  we  cannot  participate  in  the  affairs  of  our  compa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nies  in  various  countries  as  we  did  in  normal  times.  Therefore  you  are </p>
<p class="calibre1">advised  that  you  will  have  to  make  your  own  decisions  and  not  call  on  us  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  advice  or  assistance  until  further  notice."  It  was  sent  to  the  State  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment on October 10, 1941, with a request for comment.77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  State  Department  official  replied  some  two  weeks  later,  "While  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  is  glad  to  be  informed  of  your  intentions  in  this  matter,  it  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">no specific comment to make at this time." To this perfunctory response, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  very  cautiously  answered,  "Thank  you  very  much  for  your  letter  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">October 23, 1941."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  cable  to  all  subsidiaries  involved  with  Axis  nations  was  approved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  October  1941  instruction  did  not  order  his  subsidiaries  to  stop  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ducing  punch  cards  for  Nazi  Germany.  It  did  not  order  them  to  cease  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">operations.  It  did  not  set  limits  on  which  projects  they  could  participate  in.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  not  require  offices  in  neutral  countries  to  stop  supporting  Hitler's  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gram.  It  did  not  proscribe  uses  in  census  or  registration  operations.  It  did  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  demand  that  spare  parts  no  longer  be  sent  to  machines  in  concentration </p>
<p class="calibre1">camps.  All  that  business  continued.  The  cable  merely  directed  managers  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">to "call on us for any advice or assistance until further notice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  21,  1941,  the  Treasury  Department  finally  issued  IBM  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">license  to  communicate  the  authorization  to  split  the  stock—more  than  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">month  after  the  fact.79  A  week  later,  long  after  IBM  submitted  its  license  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">instruct all subsidiaries to stop communicating, Chauncey spoke again to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commercial Attache Woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: We have received a license from the Treasury Department for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">increase in the Dehomag stock and are sending out a cable to that effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS:  It  has  been  done.  Your  attorney  here  had  it  done  the  next  day  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">my  telephone  conversation  with  Mr.  Watson  because  Mr.  Watson  had  said </p>
<p class="calibre1">that it would be all right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Was the stock issued proportionately? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woods: Yes, you have received your full share... </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  But  the  stock  at  present  has  been  issued  so  that  IBM  is  [the] </p>
<p class="calibre1">owner of its proportionate amount of the increase? </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS: Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY:  What  I  called  you  for  was  to  explain  that  in  authorizing  this  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">crease  we  wish  to  be  sure  that  the  additional  shares  to  the  other  stock- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holders  were  included  in  their  existing  agreements  and  their  agreements </p>
<p class="calibre1">made to conform to the present circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS: I do not know about that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Will you see Dr. Albert and have him arrange accordingly? Also, </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  Dr.  Albert  return  to  you  the  power  of  attorney  which  I  gave  him  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">cause  of  my  personal  liability  for  any  act  which  I  might  commit  under  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">If,  in  the  future,  anything  is  required  to  be  done  we  can  release  the  power </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  specific  instructions  provided  we  have  a  license  from  the  Treasury </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS:  I  will  see  the  attorney  in  a  few  minutes  and  tell  him.  Do  you  want </p>
<p class="calibre1">me to destroy the power of attorney when it is returned? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: NO, you keep it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS:  Well,  you  know  it  is  possible  that  we  may  leave  here  [in  the  event </p>
<p class="calibre1">war is declared], and then do you want me to destroy it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WOODS: Dr. Kiep and the others send their regards to all of you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAUNCEY: We, in turn, send our regards to them.80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  faced  coundess  additional  emergencies  throughout  fall  1941,  large </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  small,  as  it  sought  to  protect  its  profits  and  control  of  its  extended  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  subsidiary.  In  one  such  crisis,  Heidinger  was  waging  yet  another  voting </p>
<p class="calibre1">putsch.  On  December  3,  as  America  sensed  it  stood  at  the  brink  of  war,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly  nervous  Chauncey  again  appeared  at  the  State  Department  with  yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  emergency  message  to  be  conveyed  to  Berlin.  Mr.  Luthringer  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  officer  on  duty.  Chauncey  gave  his  IBM  business  card  to  the  clerk.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  had  no  address,  title,  or  phone  number  on  it,  just  the  imprint  "Harrison </p>
<p class="calibre1">K. Chauncey, International Business Machines Corp., New York."81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  clerk  wrote  on  the  card,  "Do  you  want  to  see[?]"  and  drew  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrow to Chauncey's name. Luthringer agreed to see him.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  was  carrying  a  message,  and  again  there  was  no  time  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">secure  a  Treasury  License.  Would  the  State  Department  object  to  sending  it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  way,  the  U.S.  government  would  be  sending  the  message,  not  IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's message was intended for Dehomag through the Geneva office. It </p>
<p class="calibre1">read: "Resolution of Executive and Finance Committee of Board of Directors </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  we  will  not  consent  to  any  change  in  authority  to  vote  our  stock  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag. Dehomag is owned by IBM to the extent of approximately 84 per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent and IBM cannot consent to any change in voting control or any other </p>
<p class="calibre1">changes until emergency is over. Please inform Albert and Kiep."83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luthringer kept notes on his conversation with Chauncey, whom he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had met before. "During a previous visit," Luthringer wrote, "he had referred </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the fact that the German army used quantities of his company's accounting </p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery. Apparendy, the Germans move such machinery along with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">army in the field." Luthringer added, "I had a feeling from Mr. Chauncey's </p>
<p class="calibre1">general  remarks  that  he  is  somewhat  perturbed  for  fear  that  his  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">may some day be blamed for cooperating with the Germans."84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four  days  later,  Pearl  Harbor  was  bombed.  The  U.S.  finally  joined  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  against  Germany.  Dehomag  and  all  Watson  subsidiaries  under  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">control  would  now  be  managed  by  Nazi-appointed  trustees.  IBM  Europe  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 1   F R A N C E   AND  HOLLAND </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOLLAND      WAS      INVADED      IN      MAY      1940.      QUICKLY,    THE   </p>
<p class="calibre1">COUNTRY was   subjugated  to  a  German  civil  administration.   More  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">140,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well </p>
<p class="calibre1">as </p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees </p>
<p class="calibre1">from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazism, lived in Holland on the day of invasion.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  fell  a  month  later.  After  the  June  1940  armistice,  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  divided  into  two  zones.  A  so-called  Occupied  Zone  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">north,  which  included  Paris,  was  ruled  by  a  German  military  gover- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor  backed  up  by  the  army  and  Himmler's  Gestapo  units.  In  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">south,  a  collaborationist  regime  was  popularly  referred  to  as  Vichy </p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  after  the  town  of  Vichy  where  the  government  was  head- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quartered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alsace-Lorraine </p>
<p class="calibre1">was </p>
<p class="calibre1">annexed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Approximately </p>
<p class="calibre1">300,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  lived  in  all  of  France  prior  to  occupation  and  dismemberment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About 200,000 of those lived in the Paris area.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">German </p>
<p class="calibre1">intentions </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">both </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries </p>
<p class="calibre1">were </p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly </p>
<p class="calibre1">identical </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolded  in  a  similar  sequence  throughout  the  war  years.  But  every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  about  the  occupation  of  these  lands  and  their  involvement </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  Hitler's  Holleriths  was  very  different.  For  the  Jews  of  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">two nations, their destinies would also be quite different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequently </p>
<p class="calibre1">exploited </p>
<p class="calibre1">ethnic </p>
<p class="calibre1">antagonism </p>
<p class="calibre1">between </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  groups  in  Eastern  Europe  and  ignited  long  simmering  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitism  with  Fascist  surrogates  in  such  lands  as  Yugoslavia,  Slo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vakia, Romania, and Hungary. Jews in Eastern Europe often lived </p>
<p class="calibre1">apart  from  the  larger  society  and  were  subject  to  class  resentment  exacer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bated  by  religious  isolation.  By  clever  manipulation,  the  Third  Reich  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">able  to  divide  and  conquer  democratic  or  monarchical  sovereignties,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  enlist  the  aid  of  local  Jew-haters  to  legislate  and  regiment  the  methodi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cal destruction of the Jewish community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was different in France and Holland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Netherlands, the population was, with notable exceptions, funda- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mentally  homogeneous.   Certainly,   traditional  Portuguese,   colonial,   and </p>
<p class="calibre1">recent refugee groups each occupied their own niche. Ethnic rivalries, how- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever, were largely non-existent and could not be exploited. Dutch Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained a closely knit community. Only some 12,400 (less than 10 per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent) did not affiliate with either of the two leading Jewish ancestral groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Less than an estimated 2,000 had drifted into Christianity. But Dutch Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were nonetheless almost completely integrated. Jews could be found among </p>
<p class="calibre1">the leaders of literature, jurisprudence, physics, medicine, and manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing. Jewish organizations were secularized. Intermarriage was common. By </p>
<p class="calibre1">1930, some 41 percent of the community was in a mixed marriage. Dutch </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry lived in harmony and acceptance as productive citizens of Holland.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">France  was  ethnically  diverse,  weaving  Jews,  Christians,  and  Moslems </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  across  Europe,  Asia,  and  Africa  into  the  fabric  of  French  society.  Cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tainly,  strong  racial  and  religious  undercurrents  continuously  rippled,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes  exploded.  Anti-Semitism  had  been  a  fact  of  life  in  France  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">generations—as  it  had  been  throughout  Europe.  The  term  J'Accuse  was  born </p>
<p class="calibre1">amidst  the  outrage  over  the  Dreyfus  Affair.  Yet  the  French  had  by  and  large </p>
<p class="calibre1">learned  to  live  with  ethnic  diversity  as  a  strength  of  their  national  culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">French Jewry  was  as  completely  assimilated  as  many  of  their  coreligionists  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Jews  in  France  achieved  prominence  in  science,  the  arts,  and  poli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tics.  France  cherished  her  Jewish  painters  Pissaro,  Chagall,  and  Modigliani. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theatergoers  loved  Sarah  Bernhardt.  Men  of  letters  such  as  Marcel  Proust </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Henri  Bergson  enjoyed  wide  followings.  In  1936,  Leon  Blum  became </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  first  Jew  elected  premier.  Yet  Talmudic  studies  all  but  disappeared.  Bap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tized  or  unaffiliated  Jews  were  commonly  found  throughout  a  Jewish  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">munity that considered itself French first.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Holland,  punch  cards  were  a  well-developed  statistical  tool.  As  early </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  1916,  the  Central  Statistical  Bureau  began  tracking  import  and  export  data </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Hollerith  machines  purchased  from  an  agent  for  the  German  company.  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">1923,  Dutch  industry  was  adopting  the  technology.  The  Amsterdam  City </p>
<p class="calibre1">Electricity  Works  became  the  first  public  utility  in  the  world  to  use  an  actual </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch card as a regular customer bill. After two Dutch statisticians visited </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin for demonstrations, the Netherlands chose Hollerith machines to tab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulate  its  1930  census.  By  1937,  a  centralized  "machine  park"  was  developed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  serve  a  multiplicity  of  government  clients.  To  save  money,  the  Dutch  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment  integrated  some  locally  produced  punchers  manufactured  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kamatec and Kamadex.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watson  established  a  card  printing  plant  in  the  Netherlands  in  1936.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">1939,  IBM  located  a  training  school  in  Amsterdam  for  its  European  sales </p>
<p class="calibre1">force.  By  that  time,  the  Netherlands  was  preparing  for  wartime  disruptions  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">inventorying  all  sources  and  stores  of  the  nation's  food  stocks.  Ration  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  regularly  issued  to  all  civilians.  All  information  was  punched  onto  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">and sorted by IBM equipment.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  outbreak  of  World  War  II,  Holland  standardized  on  IBM  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vices.  By  1941,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  alone  operated  40  machines,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">used  1  million  Hollerith  cards  monthly,  continuously  punched  by  a  staff  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">120  punching  secretaries.  The  Statistical  Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  Economics </p>
<p class="calibre1">utilized  98  IBM  machines.  The  Central  Statistical  Bureau's  usage  had  em- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ployed  64  machines.  All  tolled,  the  Dutch  federal  government  leased  326  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines  from  IBM,  with  an  additional  176  Holleriths  located  in  21  provincial </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices,  municipal  bureaus,  and  semi-official  agencies.  Fifteen  key  corpora- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  used  169  machines.  More  than  320  machines  were  employed  by  non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">essential  private  enterprises.  Having  surpassed  its  own  card  printing  needs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  1941,  IBM  NY  was  annually  shipping  Holland  132  million  cards  printed </p>
<p class="calibre1">in America. Unquestionably, Holland automated its data with Holleriths.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  IBM  did  not  operate  a  subsidiary  in  Holland  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenties  and  thirties.  The  company  relied  upon  highly  paid  sales  agents  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">close  deals.  Dehomag  in  conjunction  with  IBM  Geneva  supplied  the  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  and  expertise.  Watson  had  opened  new  subsidiaries  in  Poland  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">conquered  territories  just  before  or  after  the  Germans  invaded.  It  was  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">different in Holland. On March 20, 1940, just as Hitler was preparing to launch </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  spring  invasions  of  the  Low  Countries  and  Western  Europe,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed  to  incorporate  Watson  Bedrijfsmachine  Maatschappij  N.V.—the  Dutch </p>
<p class="calibre1">name  for  Watson  Business  Machines  Corporation.  Reich  armies  took  Den- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mark on April 9, Norway on May 2, and Luxembourg on May 10. On May 10, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany also launched its conquest of Holland—it only took five days.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  the  spring  invasions,  the  flow  of  punch  cards  to  Holland </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  uninterrupted.  Just  before  the  war  came  to  the  Netherlands'  border, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  approved  an  agreement  with  the  Central  Statistical  Bureau  to  supply </p>
<p class="calibre1">enough  cards  to  last  a  year.  When  the  Germans  entered  Holland,  they  took </p>
<p class="calibre1">possession of that supply.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  originally  incorporated  in  March  1940,  two  owners  of  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bedrijfsmachine  were  listed.  I B M   NY  was  shown  owning  90  percent  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutch  company,  with  10  percent  held  by  J.  W.  Schotte,  General  Manager  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Kurope.  Although  a  mere  nominee,  Schotte's  shares  created  the  appear- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ance  of  a  Dutch  national  as  principal.  Even  though  Schotte  lived  in  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  IBM  initially  listed  him  as  general  manager  of  the  Dutch  subsidiary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly, however, IBM NY decided to vest all real power in another manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">named  Pieter  van  Ommeren.  Since  by  that  time  the  Netherlands  was  occu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pied,  IBM's  secretary-treasurer,  J.  G.  Phillips,  on  September  17,  wrote  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Netherlands  Consulate  General  in  exile  for  permission  to  circumvent  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rules  of  incorporation.  Phillips'  sworn  letters  to  the  Consulate  never  identi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied Schotte as IBM's European General Manager in New York, but merely as </p>
<p class="calibre1">a Dutch "merchant" who was "sojourning in the United States."10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  months  later,  on  December  7,  1940,  as  part  of  Watson's  move  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">create  the  appearance  of  non-communication  and  reassure  Nazi  occupiers  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">non-control,  van  Ommeren  filed  an  unusual  amendment  to  the  articles  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporation.  This  amendment  deleted  the  standard  clause  of  closely  held </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations  to  facilitate  communications.  The  words  "by  telegraph"  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">removed  from  the  phrase  "Shareholders  can  be  consulted  in  lieu  of  meeting </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  writing  or  telegraph."  From  December  1940  to  mid-June  1941,  IBM  exec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">utives  undertook  the  protracted  legal  applications  to  ensure  that  the  exiled </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutch  consulate  approved  the  power  of  attorney  given  to  Ommeren.11  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted  to  make  sure  that  all  of  its  corporate  acts  in  Holland  were  recognized </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  only  by  the  Nazi  civil  administration,  but  the  exiled  government  as  well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  operation  in  France  was  "promising"—but  from  the  first  years,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">small  and  fragmented  market.  In  1919,  CTR  established  its  first  European </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales  office  in  Paris,  using  Heidinger's  original  Dehomag  as  sales  agent.  With </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  a  dozen  French  customers,  IBM  France,  in  1925,  opened  a  manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing factory and a branch in Lyon. As late as 1927, IBM was fighting a pitched </p>
<p class="calibre1">battle with rival Powers Company for the small French market. Each firm had </p>
<p class="calibre1">snared  just  30  customers  using  approximately  50  sorters  and  tabulators  fed </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  about  300  punching  stations.  Then  in  1931,  the  Swiss  company,  Bull, </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared in France with a new low-cost integrated machine that seemed to </p>
<p class="calibre1">outperform  the  Hollerith.  Bull's  first  installation  was  at  the  French  Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Labor.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  though  Bull  enjoyed  but  a  single  client  in  1931,  Watson  saw  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  company  as  a  significant  threat.  IBM  ramped  up  its  competitive  machin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ery to neutralize the new firm. Watson personally inspected Bull machines at </p>
<p class="calibre1">French government offices with an eye toward buying the company outright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  about  that  time,  IBM  signed  up  the  French  Ministry  of  War  which  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  a  major  client  for  complex  Hollerith  systems.  By  1932,  IBM  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  expanded  to  more  than  sixty-five  customers.  Protracted  discussions </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  Watson  and  French  Bull  owners  broke  down.  So  IBM  purchased  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">original  Bull  rights  in  Switzerland,  this  to  the  shock  of  French  Bull.  Immedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ately  after  closing  the  deal,  Watson  went  further,  hiring  Emile  Genon,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  Bull  manager  who  had  sold  IBM  the  Swiss  rights.  French  Bull  voted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">dishonor  the  contract  as  anti-competitive  and  even  moved  to  separate  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  Swiss  sister  company.  The  serpentine  Bull  acquisition  controversy  led  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  of  lawsuits  in  Switzerland  and  France  as  IBM  challenged  Bull's  right  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">sell its own designs, and Bull sued for unfair competition.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  restructured  his  French  organization  in  1936,  creating  a  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary  named  Compagnie  Electro-Comptable  de  France,  or  CEC.  By  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">outbreak  of  war,  CEC  had  hundreds  of  machines  installed,  many  of  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrated  in  just  three  sectors:  banking,  railroad,  and  the  military.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">now  dominated  the  French  market  with  about  65  percent  of  usage  in  France </p>
<p class="calibre1">proper,  and  virtually  the  entire  market  in  France's  colonies,  especially  North </p>
<p class="calibre1">Africa  and  Indochina.  Bull,  beset  by  financial  problems,  undoubtedly  linked </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  its  endless litigation  with  IBM,  secured  only  25  percent  of  the  French  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ket  share,  mainly  among  governmental  and  banking  clients.  Powers  clung  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">its marginal 10 percent segment.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  France  edged  closer  to  war  in  the  late  thirties,  French  War  Ministry </p>
<p class="calibre1">orders  greatly  exceeded  CEC's  limited  factory  output.  From  1937,  excess </p>
<p class="calibre1">French  military  orders  were  placed  directly  with  IBM  NY.  In  the  approxi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately  two  years  before  war  erupted  in  1939,  IBM  NY  shipped  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  alphabetizes  yielding  nearly  a  half  million  dollars  in  rentals,  as  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  $350,000  in  spare  parts.  All  of  France  utilized  some  426  million  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  in  those  two  pre-war  years;  they  were  printed  locally,  ordered  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">other European subsidiaries, or imported from the U.S.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  everything  changed  in  French  automation  when  the  country  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">partitioned  in  June  1940.  The  Franco-German  June  armistice  was  signed </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  than  three  weeks  after  Watson  returned  Hitler's  decoration.  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">revolt  was  in  its  initial  tempest  state.  Nazi  forces  immediately  seized  hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dreds  of  CEC  Holleriths.  A  special  "requisitioning"  platoon  familiar  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  tabulators  was  attached  to  the  First  Panzer  Division  to  effect  the  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fiscation.  Machines  were  carted  off  from  CEC's  warehouse  and  workshops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  even  removed  from  CEC's  customers,  such  as  the  electric  company  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strasbourg and a gamut of armament firms. The largest collection of Hol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leriths  was  swept  from  France's  War  Ministry,  especially  the  Ministry's  tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tor service."' </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  all,  319  Holleriths  were  commandeered,  spirited  out  of  France,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">dispersed  to  waiting  Reich  customers  throughout  Germany,  Dozens  of  verifi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers,  sorters,  and  alphabetizes  were  placed  at  the  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  its  many  punch  card  field  offices  throughout  conquered  Europe.  Many  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  devices  were  assigned  to  key  German  war  industry  companies.  Some </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  deployed  at  Nazi  occupation  offices  in  Krakow  and  Prague.  The  largest </p>
<p class="calibre1">group  of  Holleriths  was  transported  to  Luftwaffe  bases  and  the  German  High </p>
<p class="calibre1">Command.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  officials  logged  each  machine  by  original  client  location,  serial </p>
<p class="calibre1">number,  and  leasing  valuation  so  CEC  could  make  a  claim  in  Berlin  for  pay- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment. These logs were sent to IBM NY for review as soon as they became </p>
<p class="calibre1">available.  Likewise,  German  authorities  kept  meticulous  records  of  each  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  319  requisitioned  machines  by  original  site,  monthly  leasing  cost,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  location  within  Nazi  Europe.  Although  the  machines  at  first  were  for- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cibly  removed,  IBM  actually  found  the  action  conducive  to  better  relations </p>
<p class="calibre1">with the Reich and quite profitable. CEC managers billed the Reich for each </p>
<p class="calibre1">machine,  and  company  representatives  squabbled  with  the  authorities  over </p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  how  much  would  be  paid  for  each  device.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942  alone,  the  German  Army  paid  CEC  9.4  million  French  francs—equal  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">about $100,000—for leasing, service, spare parts, and punch cards.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,  CEC's  profits  soared.  Volume  doubled  from  1939  to  1942  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">FF101  million  for  1942.  During  that  same  period  profits  almost  quadrupled </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  FF26.6  million  in  1942,  of  which  FF16.3  milli on  was  designated  "royal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ties."  Those  monies  were  derived  almost  entirely  from  orders  placed  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  and  German  agencies.  For  example,  the  250  sorters  manufactured </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  CEC  in  1942—double  the  1938  output—were  all  ordered  by  Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  domestic  activity  CEC  did  undertake  was  generally  some  miscel- </p>
<p class="calibre1">laneous card printing and reconditioning of the oldest machines not yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">requisitioned.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly,  CEC  had  been  converted  into  a  captive  supply  source  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag.  This  was  done  with  IBM  NY's  full  concurrence.  In  fact,  to  meet </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  increasing  demand,  Watson  in  1941  approved  the  construction  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">two  new  factory  sites.  One  plant  was  added  to  the  manufacturing  complex  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vincennes, outside of Paris. A second factory compound was erected at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Essonnes, twenty miles south of Paris, not far from rail facilities. A March 24. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1941, report from CEC management to IBM NY explained, "The equipment </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanned  by  our  customers...  has  caused  that  the  capacity  of  our  present </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  at  Vincennes  was  bound  to  be  exceeded  very  rapidly."  Until  the  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  was  completed,  CEC  would  use  o u t s i d e   "jobbers"  to  supply  parts.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  was  continuously  kept  informed  about  CEC's  progress  by  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">variety  of  formal  and  informal  means.  Sometimes,  it  was  just  a  handwritten </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter,  such  as  the  one  written  in  English  to  a  manufacturing  executive  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Endicott  by  Dehomag  engineer  Oskar  Hoermann.  Hoermann  was  a  principal </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM liaison between the German company, the MB in Berlin, and CEC. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LYON, FRANCE </p>
<p class="calibre1">April 30, 1942 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Jimmy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  am  on  a  business  trip  in  the  unoccupied  France  and  take  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  of  giving  a  sign  of  myself.  I  am  not  in  the  army  yet,  since </p>
<p class="calibre1">we  have  become  increasingly  important.  Even  C.E.C.  Paris  works  for  us </p>
<p class="calibre1">now.  We  opened  up  a  small  assembly  plant  in  Kuchen,  50  miles  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sindelfmgen,  and  will  soon  open  up  another  little  plant  about  100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">miles  away.  Not  because  we  think  it  wise  to  decentralize,  but  because </p>
<p class="calibre1">we  have  to  move  our  work  where  we  have  workers  available.  Once  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  I  go  to  Paris.  They  have  purchased  a  second  little  plant  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">Essonnes,  about  30  miles  from  P[aris].  The  main  office  has  moved  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Place Vendome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How are you people at Endicott? ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">With my very best regards to you and your family, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remain yours </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">O.E. Hoermann21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  Endicott's  executive  offices  received  Hoermann's  handwritten  let- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter July 20, 1942, in the morning mail.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  most  reports  to  Watson  were  far  more  detailed.  For  example,  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">early  1943,  more  than  a  year  after  the  U.S.  entered  World  War  II,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">received  CEC's  regular  quarterly  financial  report  for  the  fourth  quarter  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942.  The  thirty-two-page,  single-spaced  report  summarized  in  great  detail, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  illustrated  with  numerous  tables,  all  the  fiscal  pluses  and  minuses  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC's  business  with  Germany.  Income  columns  for  each  month,  expressed </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  French  francs,  showed  the  increase  over  the  previous  year,  with  a  1942 </p>
<p class="calibre1">total of FF16.311 million compared to 194l's FF11.377 million. January </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942 income was particularly impressive  showing revenue of FF1.2 million— </p>
<p class="calibre1">double from a year earlier. Sp e c i a l  notes attributed FF9.4 million, or about </p>
<p class="calibre1">$100,00,  "paid  by  the  German  Army  for  rental  of  requisitioned  machines." </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  managers  were  careful  to  include  detailed  charts  of  how  the  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sidiary's  performance  measured  up  against  its  assigned  profit  quota—a  point </p>
<p class="calibre1">system—established by IBM NY.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sales  and  expenses  were  analyzed  by  financial  quarter  and  product. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Competitor  activities  at  Bull  and  Powers  were  summarized  for  both  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occupied  Zone  and  Vichy.  Line  items  were  entered  for  maintenance  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  used  by  the  German  High  Command,  FF304,059,  plus  an  extra </p>
<p class="calibre1">adjustment  of  FF3.79  million  for  yet  another  category  of  machines  and  main- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tenance provided to the German High Command.24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC's  report  also  emphasized  France's  dire  paper  shortages.  The  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  temporarily  authorized  a  Dehomag  paper  vendor  to  supply  CEC,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  permission  had  ended  because  of  Europe's  general  scarcity.  "The  out- </p>
<p class="calibre1">look  was  very  dark,"  CEC's  report  confessed,  adding,  "we  tried  to  obtain </p>
<p class="calibre1">paper  by  all  available  means."  By  scrounging  from  source  to  source,  CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped  it  could  persevere  a  few  weeks  at  a  time.  Among  its  precious  remain- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing stock of 262 rolls was a cache of 93 rolls from IBM NY.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Symptomatic  of  the  paper  scarcity,  CEC  reported,  was  the  summer </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942  crisis  at  Mandeure,  the  French  subsidiary's  one  remaining  paper  sup- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plier.  Mandeure  warned  CEC  that  it  could  not  supply  further  paper  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards  without  additional  shipments  of  the  vital  coal  and  cellulose  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  for  pulping.  Claiming  an  emergency,  CEC  was  able  to  intervene  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  rationing  authorities,  "pressing  them  for  an  allotment  of  coal  and  cellu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lose  to  'Mandeure'....  This  allows  us,"  reported  CEC,  "to  live  under  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">drastic  restrictions  which  we  imposed  on  our  customers."  But  by  the  end  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1942, even CEC's compromise alternative suppliers were being exhausted.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  CEC  could  only  hope  profits  would  continue  to  rise  based  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">increased  machine  orders  for  the  Reich  supplemented  by  ancillary  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  services.  CEC's  1942  report  itemized  for  IBM  NY  a  wealth  of  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">orders  aggressively  being  filled  despite  wartime  conditions.  Order  #52769 </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  50  collators  would  commence  shortly  with  five  machines  monthly.  Order </p>
<p class="calibre1">#'55158  for  an  additional  100  collators  would  be  scheduled  as  soon  as  raw </p>
<p class="calibre1">materials  permitted.  Order  #52768  for  50,000  sorting  brushes  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfied with 5,000 per month.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition,  CEC's  report  listed  its  crucial  training  courses  for  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  operators.  Course  #10B  enrolled  45  keypunch  students.  Course  11B </p>
<p class="calibre1">enrolled an additional 45 students. Course #12B taught 36 students. Schools </p>
<p class="calibre1">for    Hollerith  operators  were  conducted  night  and  day  with  course  #131 </p>
<p class="calibre1">training 94  evening students, course #133 t r a i n i n g   16 day students, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">courses  #134  and  #135  enrolling  a  t o t a l   of  86  more.28  Germany's  voracious </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor  and  military  draft  requirements  had  created  a  punch  card  emergency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  was  not  only  churning  out  machines  and  punch  cards,  but  also  skill ed </p>
<p class="calibre1">operators to make them work for Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  further  expand  its  market,  CEC  was  aggressively  serving  clients  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">France's  colonial  territories  now  controlled  by  Vichy.  Of  CEC's  848  em- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ployees,  5  worked  at  CEC  offices  in  Algeria,  5  in  Casablanca,  and  3  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indochina.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  had  become  a  veritable  satellite  of  Dehomag.  The  subsidiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained  a  direct  link  to  the  Nazi  Party.  Although  Watson's  director  gen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eral  was  Roger  Virgile,  the  Nazis  had  appointed  one  of  their  own  men,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag agent named Heinz Westerholt, to act as CEC's Kommissar. Wester- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holt was more than a Dehomag employee. He joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  May  1,  1933,  shortly  after  Hitler  assumed  power;  the  Party  issued  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">membership  #2,781,981.  Later  that  year,  Westerholt  was  inducted  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">SS,  which  issued  him  identification  #272,239.  In  October  1934,  Westerholt </p>
<p class="calibre1">became a management employee of Dehomag.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  was  aware  of  Westerholt  and  his  Party  connections  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">outset.  Westerholt  first  became  active  in  CEC's  business  when  he  visited </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris  in  summer  1940  during  the  Nazi  effort  to  create  a  punch  card  cartel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  kept  tabs  on  Westerholt  by  a  combination  of  rumors  and  reports </p>
<p class="calibre1">relayed  through  IBM  Geneva,  and  remained  in  constant  contact  with  CEC, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well  as  Otto  Kiep  and  attorney  Albert  in  Berlin.  Chauncey  clearly  identi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied  Westerholt  to  New  York  as  the  Dehomag  agent  with  Nazi  Party  status </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  was  deployed  to  undermine  IBM's  interest  in  Paris.  For  his  part,  Wester- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holt  was  among  those  incensed  at  Watson  for  slighting  der  Fuhrer.  At  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">point,  Westerholt  openly  repeated  Dehomag's  prevailing  view:  Watson's  opin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ions  were  "not  of  great  importance"  because  he  had  returned  Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">medal.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  cooperation  with  the  Third  Reich  was  imperative  for  Watson.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">recurring  crisis  of  IBM  retaining  its  dominance  in  Axis  punch  card  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  was  again  peaking  in  fall  1941.  The  urge  to  create  a  German-controlled </p>
<p class="calibre1">cartel  was  again  confronting  IBM  NY.  In  that  vein,  the  Reich  began  to  view </p>
<p class="calibre1">CEC  as  one  of  a  geographical  triad  of  IBM  subsidiaries  along  with  Beige </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson in Brussels and Watson Bedrijfsmachine Maatschappi in Amsterdam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  director  of  Beige  Watson  was  former  Bull  Director  Emile  Genon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The director of CEC was Roger Virgile. P. Taylor was Watson's trouble- </p>
<p class="calibre1">shooter in IBM Geneva. In September 1941, Cenon wrote a confidential let- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter  to  Taylor  at  IBM  Geneva  discussing  Watsons  intentions  for  CEC.  A  copy </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Genon's  letter  ended  up  in  the  hands  of  Justice  Department  investigators </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking  into  IBM's  many  special  Treasury  licenses.  The  Justice  Department </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  State  Department  summarized  the  letter:  "Political  affairs  in  France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transmits  copies  of  letter  addressed  to  Mr.  P.  Taylor,  International  Business </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machines  Corporation  and  written  by  E.  Genon,  which  indicates  that  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">T.H.J.  Watson  approved  Mr.  Virgile's  policy  of  collaboration  with  Germany."32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  France,  IBM's  collaboration  required  working  with  the  SS  via  West- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erholt.  Indeed,  IBM  NY  suspected  that  when  America  entered  the  war,  West- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erholt  might  be  designated  custodian  of  CEC,  since  he  had  poignandy </p>
<p class="calibre1">discussed  the issue  of enemy  receivership  with Virgile.  In  the  second  week  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">October  1941,  Westerholt  returned  to  Paris  for  further  consultations  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Virgile.  Westerholt  met  Virgile  on  October  13,  when  he  warned  that  Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag  was  now  prepared  to  break  its  contract  with  IBM  NY  on  a  legal  "pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">text."  The  German  authorities  understood  that  Bull  lacked  the  manufacturing </p>
<p class="calibre1">muscle  to  supply  the  Reich,  but  Berlin  still  hoped  it  could  use  Bull  designs </p>
<p class="calibre1">and patents to start its own factory. Toward that aim, license agreements had </p>
<p class="calibre1">already  been  signed.  In  view  of  the  threat  to  IBM  Europe  if  the  company  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not cooperate, Westerholt wanted an immediate meeting at Lyon in Vichy. He </p>
<p class="calibre1">sent word to Werner C. Lier, Watson's most senior official at IBM Geneva.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Lier  considered  Westerholt's  invitation,  he  filed  a  full  report  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY.  In  his  note,  Lier  warned  that  if  the  U.S.  entered  the  war,  as  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">imminently  expected,  a  custodian  for  CEC  would  "have  the  effect  of  reduc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  the  amount  of  reports  which  we  have  been  able  to  receive  from  CEC  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">and create a situation somewhat similar to that of the Dehomag." That in </p>
<p class="calibre1">mind, Lier needed New York's permission to attend and bring CEC Sales </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manager William Borel as Virgile's representative.34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three days later on October 16, an impatient Lier cabled IBM NY: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Competition affair serious. Genon learned Vichy . . . definitely able destroy </p>
<p class="calibre1">our European business in cooperation with foreign group, previously men- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tioned. . . . Following telephone call Borel I received today written report </p>
<p class="calibre1">stating Westerholt confirmed Virgile reality our fears. . . . Also threatened </p>
<p class="calibre1">appointment foreign custodian Paris with program suppressing relations with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva. Westerholt wants see me Lyon. . . . Will see him only with your ap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">proval. Please instruct all matters."35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, Lier contacted Berlin to obtain the latest intelligence on </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's rebellious actions. He summarized the effort for New York. "Due </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the courtesy of the American Consulate in Geneva," Lier reported, "it was </p>
<p class="calibre1">possible for us to speak on the morning of October 17th to the United States </p>
<p class="calibre1">Embassy  in  Berlin.  Mr.  Woods,  the  Commercial  Attache,  being  absent,  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">explained  to  his  assistant  our  desire  to  find  out  something  more  definite  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cerning  Dehomag's  intention  of  breaking  the  contract  with  us.  In  the  after- </p>
<p class="calibre1">noon  Mr.  Woods  called  us  in  Geneva  and  told  us  that  he  had  seen  Dr.  Albert </p>
<p class="calibre1">who  had  admitted,  though  in  a  rather  vague  manner,  that  he  had  heard  cer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  rumors  about  Dehomag's  intention  but  .  .  .  could  not  give  a  definite </p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion as to the legal aspects of the matter."36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thereafter,  Lier  concluded  that  a  meeting  with  "Westerholt  could  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">longer  be  postponed.  Lier  cabled  New  York,  "Recab  [re:  cable]  competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intend  go  Vichy  with  Genon  Wednesday  trying  prevent  or  slowing  juridical </p>
<p class="calibre1">materialization  agreement  between  two  groups."  On  October  20,  IBM  NY </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied,  "No  objection  your  seeing  Westerholt.  Make  no  commitments  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">take  no  action."  Lier  confirmed  that  he  would  immediately  leave  for  Lyon </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  it  was  "in  the  best  interests  of  the  IBM  to  delay  as  much  as  possible </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  official  ratification  of  the  agreement  between  the  Bull  and  W  [Wanderer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Werke] groups."37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  initial  meeting  between  Lier  and  Westerholt  was  only  the  begin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ning.  The  Nazis  wanted  a  second,  much  broader  conference,  this  one  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin,  and  involving  CEC's  entire  senior  staff.  Again,  Lier  would  not  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceed  without  Watson's  specific  permission.  On  November  17,  1941,  CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">cabled  IBM  NY:  "Meeting  Berlin  November  21  with  Virgile  Westerholt  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suggest  you  instruct  Lier  at  once  to  attend  that  meeting  even  if  you  have  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">reached  decision  on  Kiep's  cable  November  6  to  Watson.  Have  met  Wester- </p>
<p class="calibre1">holt with Lier. Impression good. Reports follow."38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  meetings  with  Westerholt  in  Berlin  were  part  of  the  constellation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">intrigues  that  compelled  Chauncey  to  rush  to  the  State  Department  in  early </p>
<p class="calibre1">December,  just  days  before  Pearl  Harbor,  to  circumvent  Treasury  license </p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements  and  issue  financial  instructions  to  Dehomag.  Ultimately,  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  U.S.  joined  the  war  against  Germany,  Westerholt  was  appointed  the  cus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">todian  of  CEC.39  The  Nazis  were  able  to  do  with  CEC  as  they  pleased  so </p>
<p class="calibre1">long  as  IBM  was  paid.  The  looming  competition  with  Bull  never  came </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  fruition.  It  was  more  of  a  bargaining  chip  than  a  genuine  threat.  Unable  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">replace  IBM,  the  Third  Reich  pressured  the  company  into  relinquishing  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  troublesome  micro-managing  in  favor  of  the  faster  and  more  coordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated action the Reich required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  even  though  CEC  and  IBM  were  able  to  retain  their  dominance  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  vital  supplier  of  Reich  automation,  by  the  end  of  1943,  the  bleak  facts </p>
<p class="calibre1">about the punch card business in France had become undeniable. CEC </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  no  longer  obtain  reliable  supplies  of  paper  or  raw  materials.  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsi di a r y  no  longer  produced  machines  for  the  French  market  Key  workers </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  s p e c i a l   Hollerith  skills  were  being  systematically  drafted  or  transferred </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  punch  card  projects  in  the  Greater  Reich.  The  French  company's  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacturing  capacity—machines  and  parts—was  being  shipped  out  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">country  to  Germany  and  beyond.  Despite  its  soaring  revenues,  the  French </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary  saw  a  moment  of  utter  corporate  collapse  looming  in  the  near </p>
<p class="calibre1">future.40  In  the  beginning  of  1943,  just  as  CEC  was  reporting  doubled  vol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">umes and trebled profits, Virgile  was compelled to warn  IBM NY: "The  situa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  of  CEC  at  the  end  of  1942  is  very  precarious,  both  from  the  point  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">view  of  specialized  personnel,  which  is  subject  to  forced  transfer  to  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  any  moment,  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  card  supply  which  is  assured </p>
<p class="calibre1">for only a few weeks. Manufacture is proceeding with enormous and ever </p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing  delays.  Subcontractors  have  had  to  close  down  suddenly  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">decrease  their  activity  sharply  as  a  result  of  personnel  requisitions.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  part  of  our  skilled  labor  is  subject  to  immediate  call.  Under  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions, it is impossible to venture as much as a guess as to the future."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers  had  been  all  but  marginalized  in  France.  The  Germans  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  to  transfer  workshops  from  Germany  to  Paris  just  to  keep  its  almost </p>
<p class="calibre1">inactive  operation  functioning.  Even  though  Bull  had  promising  equipment </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  numerous  installations  in  France,  it  was  financially  and  operationally </p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable  of  ramping  up.  Some  Bull  machines  had  also  been  removed  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germans  and  were  being  serviced  by  IBM  personnel  in  occupied  territories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bull  was  also  desperate  for  raw  materials  to  fabricate  machines  and  paper  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacture  cards.  Berlin's  one  and  only  order  for  leased  Bull  machines  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">to be canceled before any could be delivered.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  wanted  the  Jews  identified  by  bloodline  not  religion,  pauper- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ized,  and  then  deported  to  camps,  just  as  they  were  elsewhere  in  conquered </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.  The  Jews  of  France  stood  vulnerable  under  the  shadow  of  destruc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion. Hitler was ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In France, the Holleriths were not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOLLAND  SURRENDERED  to  Germany  on  May  15,  1940,  after  just  five  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  fierce  attack.  The  Reich  immediately  began  planning  the  complete  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">struction  of  the  Dutch  Jewish  community.  Believing  that  the  total  of  ancestral </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  practicing  Jews  in  Holland  to  be  about  double  their  actual  number,  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">experts  assumed  the  campaign  against  Dutch  Jewry  would  be  phased.  More </p>
<p class="calibre1">than that, they realized all too well that the local population did not welcome </p>
<p class="calibre1">the arrival of Hitler's forces. Certainly, rabid Dutch Nazis were eager to coop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erate  with  the  occupation.  But  in  significant  measure,  at  times  citizens  of  Hol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">land  demonstrated  open  solidarity  w i t h   persecuted  Jews  and  displayed  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">unwillingness  to  deliver  their  neighbors.  Repressive  measures  against  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">provoked  a  strike  by  laborers,  frequent  demands  by  Christians  to  be  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cluded with the Jews in their misery, and even some violent riots.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Reich  needed  a  very  special  expert  to  help  to  engineer  the  round- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ups.  They  needed  a  man  who  understood  the  administrative  statistical  land- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scape  of  Holland,  one  who  was  adept  at  Hollerith  technology  and  willing  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate  in  the  face  of  popular  resistance.  In  an  occupied  nation  beset  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">neighborhood  ambushes  against  German  soldiers,  outrageous  catcalls  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cinema  when  Nazi  propaganda  films  flashed  onto  the  screen,  and  coordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nated  sermons  in  churches  everywhere  to  condemn  anti-Semitism,  Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed someone uniquely qualified to step forward.44 </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  found  their  man  in  Jacobus  Lambertus  Lentz.  He  was  not  a  Nazi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  who  have  studied  him  have  not  proven  his  innate  anti-Semitism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,  Lentz  was  a  population  expert,  cocooned  in  his  own  stacked  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tabulated  world  of  ratios,  registration  programs,  and  rattling  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.  Perfection  in  human  cataloging  was  for  Lentz  more  than  a  matter </p>
<p class="calibre1">of pride, it was a crusade.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1936,  as  Inspector  of  Population  Registries,  Lentz  standardized  local </p>
<p class="calibre1">population  registers  and  their  data  collection  methodology  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Netherlands—an  administrative  feat  that  earned  him  a  royal  decoration.  That </p>
<p class="calibre1">same  year,  he outlined his personal  vision in  Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  journal  of  the  German  Statistical  Society:  "Theoretically,"  predicted </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz,  "the  collection  of  data  for  each  person  can  be  so  abundant  and  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plete,  that  we  can  finally  speak  of  a  paper  human  representing  the  natural </p>
<p class="calibre1">human."46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  can  only  imagine  the  deep  inner  satisfaction  Lentz  derived  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">indexing  one  segment  of  the  population  after  another  with  infallible  preci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion.  He  bragged  about  his  data,  defensively  stood  by  his  summaries  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">always  anticipated  the  next  German  request  for  Jewish  names—if  for  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  reason  than  to  self-validate  his  own  "censual"  foresight.  When  light </p>
<p class="calibre1">streamed  through  the  punch  card,  Lentz  surely  saw  something  no  one  else </p>
<p class="calibre1">could.  German  occupiers  were  resented  nearly  everywhere  in  Holland.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Lentz,  his  new  Nazi  masters  had  in  fact  liberated  him  from  the  dissatis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fying  ennui  of  peacetime  social  tracking.  Now,  under  Nazism,  he  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">unleash  all  his  ideas  of  registration  and  powers  of  ratiocination  restlessly </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting to be tested. He would declare war on population ambiguity. Lentz </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  the  man  to  deliver  the  Jews  of  Holland.  His  motto  was  "to  record </p>
<p class="calibre1">is to serve."47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Step  one,  on  July  3,  1941,  was  the  identification  of  Jewish  refugees </p>
<p class="calibre1">living  in  Amsterdam,  a  number  the  Germans  erroneously  believed  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  120,000  and  150,000.  Using  police  stations  normally  charged  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">registering  aliens,  Lentz  organized  a  systematic  count.  His  numbers  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately showed far fewer refugees than expected, about 20,000.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  on  August  17,  Lentz  devised  a  unique  tamper-proof  personal </p>
<p class="calibre1">identification  card  that  could  not  be  forged.  Translucent  inks  were  employed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  print  key  words  that  disappeared  under  a  quartz  lamp.  The  stamp  franking </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  acetone-soluble.  Photos  of  the  individual  were  affixed  front  and  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  a  window  transparently  sealed  and  adhered  with  permanent  glue.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">fingerprint  of  the  person's  right  index  finger  was  then  impressed  upon  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  of  one  of  the  photos  so  it  always  displayed  through  the  small  window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  individual's  signature  on  watermarked  paper  completed  the  document, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  included  numerous  personal  details.  Lentz'  card  was  a  masterpiece  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">human documentation.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz  first  conceived  his  complex  card  in  1939  when  war  in  Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">broke  out  and  the  government  considered  foolproof  food  rationing  cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  as  recendy  as  March  1940,  a  Dutch  government  commission </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  that  such  a  card  would  treat  average  people  like  criminals,  and  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">inconsistent  with  the  nation's  democratic  tradition.  But  with  no  one  to  hold </p>
<p class="calibre1">him  back,  Lentz  perfected  his  original  card  idea  by  adding  the  photograph </p>
<p class="calibre1">and fingerprint features.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Lentz  offered  his  specimen  to  the  Criminal  Technology  Institute </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Reich  Criminal  Police  Office,  it  was  eagerly  approved.  His  innovation </p>
<p class="calibre1">outshone  anything  the  German  police  had  ever  developed,  and  clearly  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">defeat  the  many  local  attempts  to  forge  papers.  Within  weeks,  German  civil </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrators  began  requiring  all  Dutch  citizens  over  the  age  of  fourteen  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">sign  up.  It  took  about  a  year  before  everyone  was  registered.  But  Lentz'  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonal  card  was  more  than  just  an  advanced  domestic  identification.  A  second </p>
<p class="calibre1">portion  detached  at  issuance  created  a  card-like  receipt.  Those  card  receipts </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  retained  and  organized  into  massive  files  cataloging  the  personal  details </p>
<p class="calibre1">of all who lived in the Netherlands.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  Dutch  adult  was  required  to  carry  Lentz'  personal  identification </p>
<p class="calibre1">card.  But  a  feature  was  added  that  only  affected  Jews.  Eventually  the  letter  J </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  stamped  on  every  identification  card  carried  by  those  defined  as  Jewish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  manual  card  file  receipts  became  the  first  stepping-stone  toward  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">prehensive automated Dutch Jewish registration.52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On October 22, all Jewish enterprises were compelled to register. Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were defined, as in the Nuremberg Laws, according to their grandparents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  their  current  religious  affiliation.  Businesses  were  deemed  Jewish  if  any </p>
<p class="calibre1">member  of  the  ownership  or  management  was  Jewish  or  had  Jewish  ances- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors,  again  mimicking  the  decrees  espoused  earlier  in  the  Reich.  A  Bureau  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Economic  Investigation  was  formed  to  decide  whether  suspect  companies </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  actually  Jewish  under  rigid  ancestral  definitions.  As  soon  as  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">civil  authorities  in  Holland  announced  the  Jewish  commercial  registration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nation  erupted  in  protest.  Virtually  all  Protestant  churches,  that  next </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunday,  condemned  from  the  pulpit  a  Jewish  registration  they  called  "un- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian."53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  early  1941,  the  Germans  felt  they  were  ready  to  begin  the  last  phase </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  deportation.  On  January  10,  1941,  Nazi  State  Secretary  Friedrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wimmer  issued  the  all-important  decree  V06/41  requiring  all  Jews—Dutch </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  foreign—to  register  at  their  local  Census  Office.  Wimmer's  deadline  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">four  weeks  for  those  residing  outside  of  Amsterdam  and  ten  weeks  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amsterdam  residents.  Since  the  1930  census,  Dutch  Census  Offices  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">completely  automated  with  Hollerith  systems.  By  comparing  the  Jewish  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istrations  to  the  existing  total  population  card  index  created  by  the  Lentz </p>
<p class="calibre1">card, the authorities could pinpoint any Jew who failed to sign up.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  nearly  all  of  Holland  angrily  condemned  the  Nazi  registra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion,  the  Jews  did  as  instructed.  With  few  exceptions,  every  Dutch  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">family  dutifully  picked  up  its  questionnaires,  filled  them  out  completely,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">filed  with  the  nearest  registration  office.  The  uncanny  compliance  was  based </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  traditional  Dutch  respect  for  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  the  stated </p>
<p class="calibre1">penalty  for  not  registering—five  years  in  prison  and  the  confiscation  of  prop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">erty.  Jews  also  understood  that  resistance  was  futile  because  their  names  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">already  long  been  innocently  registered  as  "Jewish"  in  numerous  statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  registration  bureaus  throughout  the  Netherlands,  and  especially  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  card  indices  created  by  Lentz'  personal  identification  program.  Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">though  some  Jews  rioted  in  early  February  1941,  the  entire  community </p>
<p class="calibre1">nonetheless  filled  out  the  forms  as  required.  More  than  157,000  question- </p>
<p class="calibre1">naires  were  ultimately  returned  in  the  first  months—more  than  the  entire </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  community  because  many  sympathetic  Dutchmen  actually  volun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">teered  to  register  alongside  their  Jewish  countrymen.  Lentz'  punching  cadres </p>
<p class="calibre1">began converting the Jews to Hollerith records as quickly as possible.55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  none  of  it  was  fast  enough  for  the  Nazis.  There  were  many  delays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  decree  VO6/41  was  espoused  on  January  10,  1941,  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrators did not release it to the media until January 14, when the </p>
<p class="calibre1">news was published around the world, including in the Next York Times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the registration ruling did not become effective until January 24, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the official Dutch government gazette did not publish the details for census </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrators until its February 3 issue. Hence local Census Offices across </p>
<p class="calibre1">the country lost time in setting up registration facilities. Nonetheless, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices remained open all day and night to speed the process. Each day, thou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sands of Dutch Jews marched into the local Census Office, paid a token </p>
<p class="calibre1">guilder, and filled out the elaborate questionnaires providing the Germans </p>
<p class="calibre1">with everything they needed to know about their possessions, families, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">parentage.56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  German  authorities  at  first  praised  the  Census  Office  for  "exem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">plary"  service.  But  as  Wimmer's  early  April  deadline  approached  and  the  tal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lies  were  far  from  complete,  Lentz'  organization  was  challenged  and  rebuked </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  tardiness.  The  Germans  even  suggested  some  localities  were  sabotaging </p>
<p class="calibre1">the program.57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi administrators feared sabotage for good reason. Outraged Amster- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dam workers had spontaneously called a strike, in large part over repressive </p>
<p class="calibre1">measures.   Nazi   occupiers   suppressed   the   defiance   by  throwing   hand </p>
<p class="calibre1">grenades and firing machine guns at crowds of protesters. Violent reprisals </p>
<p class="calibre1">followed. The city of Amsterdam itself was fined 15 million guilders for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">strike.58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Lentz bristled at any suggestion his operation was doing less than </p>
<p class="calibre1">its best. As Inspector of the Population Registries, he defended his national </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation down to the local office. On March 25, he blundy wrote Wimmer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The government Inspectorate has thus far received approximately 30,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">registrations from the local registration posts. . . . the delay in registration is </p>
<p class="calibre1">definitely not based on registration posts not willing to cooperate, or any </p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotage, but on the circumstances, that the employees of the registration </p>
<p class="calibre1">posts have been overburdened (specifically caused by the identification card </p>
<p class="calibre1">decree); and on top of that, we just could not appoint key, reliable employ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ees. The delay is also caused by the great number of dubious cases and inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rogations." Acknowledging that more than a quarter million names were </p>
<p class="calibre1">expected, Lentz assured, "I have ordered a circular letter by the Ministry of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Interior to the local registration posts, in which I have again asked for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest haste."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part of Wimmer's problem was that the Nazis simply could not take a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish census in Holland. A traditional census or population count required </p>
<p class="calibre1">an army of enumerators visiting every citizen's home, diligendy filling out </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms. German administrators could not find reliable census takers to serve </p>
<p class="calibre1">among the outraged masses. A registration, on the other hand, depended </p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  Jewish  subjects  voluntarily  walking  i nt o  the  Census  Office  to  fill  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms.  That  process  was  impeded  by  the  general  day-to-day  reluctance  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">gripped  Dutch  Jewry,  overcome  only  incrementally  by  each  Jewish  family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  a  storm  of  venomous  attacks  in  the  popular  underground  media </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Amsterdam made even the staffers of local Census Offices queasy.60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  weeks  later,  on  April  9,  Lentz  was  still  offering  the  Germans  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cuses  for  the  slow  progress,  explaining  that  many  local  burgomasters  had  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet read the government gazette, which came out in February.61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of  1,050  municipalities  outside  Amsterdam,  he  reported,  1,019  had  al- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready  completed their registration.  As an  example of local difficulties,  he cited </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  town  of  Apeldoorn's  "difficulty  registering  the  inmates  of  the local Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">insane  asylum."  The  poor  inmates  could  not  provide  cogent  responses.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  May  5,  most  burgomasters  had  completed  their  registration.  For  many,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">task was easy; some 483 localities had not a single Jew to report.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  mid-May,  Wimmer's  office  was  beginning  to  understand  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">constellation  of  overlapping  local  registrations  in  Holland  fell  short  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  the  Nazi  program  of  destruction  needed.  Lentz'  numerous  Census </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offices  lacked  the  coordinated  ability  to  identify,  cross-index,  and  organize </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  names  nationally.  Only  a  centralized  Hollerith  operation  could  do </p>
<p class="calibre1">that.  Moreover,  Wimmer  wanted  the  Jews  alphabetized.  Without  alphabetiz- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing,  an  organized  step-by-step  round-up  and  deportation  to  camps  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">not occur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  May  19,  1941,  Wimmer  decided  "that  besides  the  registers  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  constructed  so  far,  a  special  alphabetical  register  should  be  made, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  pists]  all  Jews  and  Jews  of  mixed  blood,  who  are  and  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">reported  after  decree  6/41."  This  extra  dimension  would  have  tasked  Lentz' </p>
<p class="calibre1">overworked  operation.  To  date,  Lentz'  bureaus  had  not  even  turned  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">reports  on  the  first  78,119  questionnaires  filed.  While  the  Germans  wanted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">press Lentz to the maximum, they didn't want to pressure him too much.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  some  days  later,  Lentz  was  notified,  quite  carefully,  by  Hans  Cal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">meyer,  Wimmer's  chief  expert  on  Jewish  affairs.  "Dr.  Wimmer  would  like  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">see  constructed  a  register  like  the  Hollerith  punch  card  system,"  wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calmeyer.  "The  register  must  [contain]  age,  profession,  and  gender  ...  [and] </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  category  (Jew,  Mixed  I,  Mixed  II)  to  which  the  registered  belongs.  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">don't  deny  that  the  compilation  of  such  a  register  would  form  a  serious  bur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">den  for  the  Population  Registries.  However,  without  such  an  alphabetic  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ister  alongside  the  register  on  identity  cards,  and  besides  the  already  existing </p>
<p class="calibre1">registers on municipalities, the [Jewish] registration just won't be sufficient.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  will  soon  have  to  be  prepared  for  many  .  .  .  requests  about  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation  on  individuals,"  Calmeyer  continued.  "These  requests  won't  be  able </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  name  the  last  residence  of  the  requested  person  in  every  case.  Such </p>
<p class="calibre1">requests  will  form  an  extraordinary  workload  for  your  office  if  the  aforemen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tioned  alphabetical  register  is  not  compiled,  because  thus  far,  the  requests </p>
<p class="calibre1">can only be answered after searching through all municipal registers. Of </p>
<p class="calibre1">course, the municipal registers should not be neglected. . . . Pray, also let me </p>
<p class="calibre1">know  what  kind  of  punch  card  system  you  think  most  efficient  and  most  eas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ily  introduced."  Calmeyer  ended  his  note  asking  how  long  Lentz  would  need </p>
<p class="calibre1">in complete the alphabetical register.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lentz  was  ahead  of  Wimmer  and  Calmeyer.  With  barely  suppressed </p>
<p class="calibre1">braggadocio,  Lentz  replied  the  next  day,  "With  much  interest  I  have  taken </p>
<p class="calibre1">notice  of  your  letter  of  26th  of  May  1941,  in  which  you  informed  me  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">wishes  of  Sir  Secretary  of  State  Dr.  Wimmer  concerning  the  making  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">[another]  punch  card  system.  I  am  glad  to  inform  you  that  the  Inspectorate </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  already  been  creating  such  a  system  according  to  the  Hollerith  method </p>
<p class="calibre1">for several weeks."66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  months  earlier,  Lentz  had  requested  permission  from  the  Interior </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ministry  to  rent  an  extra  Hollerith  from  the  local  IBM  subsidiary.  His </p>
<p class="calibre1">expense  request  was  approved  on  April  23  and  he  was  waiting  for  the  equip- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  But  as  soon  as  the  approval  was  granted,  he  began  to  advance  work.  "I </p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  commenced  the  execution  of  the  plan,"  Lentz  informed  Cal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">meyer.  "We  have  already  made  much  progress  with  the  so-called  'coding'  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  data  and  the  punching  is  almost  ready  too,  thanks  to  the  co-operation  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  government  department.  I  add  a  model  of  the  punch  card  for  your </p>
<p class="calibre1">information.  The  machinery  has  not  arrived  yet,  but  measures  have  been </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken, so that this will soon become available."67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  a  major  problem,  though,  confessed  Lentz.  His  entire  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gram  was  based  on  numerical  identification  of  individuals,  not  alphabetical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  emphasized  to  Calmeyer,  "the  [new]  Hollerith  punch  card  system  is  not </p>
