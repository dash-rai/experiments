<p class="calibre1">International Business Machines1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">JULY 4, 1938 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Thomas J. Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">International Business Machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Sir: </p>
<p class="calibre1">I </p>
<p class="calibre1">must </p>
<p class="calibre1">offer </p>
<p class="calibre1">you </p>
<p class="calibre1">my </p>
<p class="calibre1">apologies </p>
<p class="calibre1">for </p>
<p class="calibre1">taking </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">liberty </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">write  you  and  to  request  your  kind  attention  for  the  follow- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing matter. Like many [of] Jewish confession, I am facing a </p>
<p class="calibre1">very terrible moment in life and I am obliged to leave this country and </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  procure  in  another  land  my  means  of  living.  I  am  born  on  the  17th </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  June  1906  and  was  educated  in  the  elementary  and  high  school  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  country.  During  eight  years  until  1933,  I  have  worked  as  an  opera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tor  of  the  Hollerith  punching  machine  for  the  Reich  Statistical  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  I  have  spoken  with  Mr.  Drines,  the  manager  of  the  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  in  Berlin  about  my  plans  to  find  work  abroad.  Mr.  Drines  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">advised  me  to  write  to  you  somehow  with  my  plans  and  I  hope  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  your  kind  help  I  would  be  able  to  find  work  in  a  foreign  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  doubt  you  know  the  condition  of  living  here  and  it  would  be  use- </p>
<p class="calibre1">less to give any further reasons for my immigration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  would  be  very  grateful  to  you  for  your  kind  assistance  and  please </p>
<p class="calibre1">accept in anticipation my thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoping to be favored with your reply, I remain </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sincerely Yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ilse Meyer </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMANY  WAS  bitter  for  the  Jews.  By  1937,  thousands  had  escaped  as  pau- </p>
<p class="calibre1">perized  emigrants.  But  for  those  Jews  remaining  within  the  Reich,  existence </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  a  progressively  fainter  shadow  of  its  former  self.  Driven  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">small  cities,  Jews  began  to  flood  into  Berlin  where  they  attempted  to  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinue  a  fraction  of the  civilized  life  they  once  knew.  Small  things  became  im- </p>
<p class="calibre1">portant: a cup of coffee in a cafe, a stroll in the park, cinema on the weekend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  afternoon  concert,  these  were  the  precious  relics  of  normalcy  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry  clung  to.  But  the  Nazis  would  not  permit  a  moment  of  peace.  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  subjected  to  unending  acts  of  personal  degradation  as  they  were  mar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ginalized.  The  national  humiliation  effort  was  more  than  a  cruelty  unnoticed </p>
<p class="calibre1">except  within  the  borders  of  Germany.  The  campaign  was  the  source  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">never-ending  American  newspaper  articles  and  radio  reports,  including  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the New York Times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  would  enter  cinemas  and  demand  all  Jews  rise  so  they  could  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">escorted  out.  Cafes  catering  to  Jews  were  ordered  closed  and  the  patrons </p>
<p class="calibre1">taken  into  custody.  Local  authorities  disbanded  virtually  all  Jewish  athletic </p>
<p class="calibre1">teams,  musical  societies,  and  social  clubs.  Indeed,  any  gathering  of  more  than </p>
<p class="calibre1">four Jews in a single place was forbidden. Placarded park benches warned </p>
<p class="calibre1">that Jews could not sit down. S y n a g o g u e s   were shuttered and often razed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the grand principal synagogue of Munich was replaced with a parking lot.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds  of disenfranchised  middle-class  German Jews from the </p>
<p class="calibre1">provinces tried to reestablish themselves in Berlin with small retail busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nesses. Former boot  manufacturers reappeared in shoe shops. Liquidated </p>
<p class="calibre1">apparel makers set up shop as haberdashers. Evicted professors opened </p>
<p class="calibre1">bookstores. As soon as the Nazis discovered these shoestring enterprises, </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers were frightened away and the assets targeted for confiscation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish shops were defaced with painted epithets exclaiming "Jewish Swine" </p>
<p class="calibre1">or "Out with the Jews." Not infrequently, armed Storm Troopers blockaded </p>
<p class="calibre1">the doorways. One day, the world awoke to headlines reporting a massive </p>
<p class="calibre1">racist display as  several miles  of Berlin's  main  shopping streets were </p>
<p class="calibre1">obstructed with crude, three-foot-high signs identifying exacdy which stores </p>
<p class="calibre1">were owned by Jews.4 Nazi agitators always seemed to know if owners were </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish, no matter how new the stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet for the Hitler regime, the pace of Jewish destruction was still not </p>
<p class="calibre1">swift enough nor sufficiendy complete. Although Germany's professing Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">had been identified, thousands of so-called "racial Jews" with Jewish ances- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors  dating  back  to  the  prior  century  had  yet  to  be  marked.  In  1937,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich  ordered  another  nationwide  census  that  would  prepare  the  country  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">military  mobilization,  and  for  the  Jews  would  be  the  final  and  decisive </p>
<p class="calibre1">identification  step.  Dehomag  eagerly  agreed  to  organize  the  project.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  racial  portion  of  the  census  was  designed  to  pinpoint  ancestral </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  as  defined  by  the  Nuremberg  Laws,  ensuring  no  escape  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's  anti-Semitic  campaign.  In  addition  to  the  usual  census  questions,  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">special  card  asked  whether  any  of  the  individual's  grandparents  was  Jewish, </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  completely  filled  out,  the  card  would  be  isolated  in  a  separate  enve- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lope for processing by both the census authorities and security offices.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  project,  originally  scheduled  for  May  1938,  would  be  an  enormous </p>
<p class="calibre1">undertaking  for  IBM,  requiring  a  huge  expansion  of  manpower,  machinery, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  processing  space.  Seventy  sorters,  some  sixty  tabulators,  seventy-six  mul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tipliers,  and  90  million  punch  cards  would  be  needed  for  the  RM  3.5  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">contract.  IBM  supervisors  in  Geneva,  Stockholm,  and  New  York  understood </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  difficult  the  challenge  would  be.  A  memo  from  IBM's  European  Factory </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manager J.G. Johnston to IBM  NY  supervisors  in  Sweden  specified,  "we  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  to  raise  considerable  funds  for  the  financing  of  the  RM  3.5  million  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  order"  even  though  the  Reich's  payments  would  be  distributed  over  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifteen-month  period.  Other  IBM  executives  seemed  to  sense  that  the  fordi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming racial census would represent a project so far-reaching, it would be </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  last  of  its  kind  and  therefore  IBM's  investment  would  have  to  plan  for  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary  surge.  "You  should  take  i nt o  consideration  .  .  .  the  fact  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German census order is a peak load which may not reoccur."7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Nazi  establishment  was  ecstatic  about  the  implications  for  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewry.  "In  May  of  next  year,"  bragged  the  leading  NSDAP  newspaper </p>
<p class="calibre1">Volkischer  Beobachter,  "the  largest  and  most  comprehensive  census  will  take </p>
<p class="calibre1">place.  It  will  be  larger  and  more  comprehensive  than  Germany,  and  even  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">rest  of  the  world,  has  ever  known....  it  is  the  duty  of  every  Volks-comrade  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">answer  every  single  question  completely  and  truthfully  .  .  .  [thus]  giving  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fuhrer  and  his  colleagues  the  basis  for  the  future  legislation  of  the  next  five </p>
<p class="calibre1">to ten years."8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  Nazi  bureaucrat  enthused,  "The  general  census  of  1938  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">intended  to  also  determine  the  blood-wise  configuration  of  the  German  pop- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulation.  .  .  .  the  results  could  also  be  recorded  on  the  police  department's </p>
<p class="calibre1">technical  registration  cards.  The  police  would  thus  gain  an  insight  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">racial  composition  of  the  persons  living  in  their  jurisdictions.  And  this  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">also accomplish the goals set by the Main Office of the Security Police."9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  much-anticipated  May  1938  census  was  delayed.  On  March  13, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938,  the  Third  Reich  absorbed  Austria,  creating  a  Greater  Germany  of  73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million  people.  Hitler  called  it  the  Anschluss,  or  "Annexation."  The  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitic  program  that  had  evolved  over  the  years  in  Germany  now  rapidly </p>
<p class="calibre1">took  hold  in  the  Austrian  provinces—virtually  overnight.  First  came  the  vio- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lence.  Jewish  merchants  were  rounded  up  and  publicly  beaten,  their  stores </p>
<p class="calibre1">looted.  Viennese  crowds  cheered  when  Jewish  men  and  women  were  forced </p>
<p class="calibre1">to their knees to scrub streets as rifle butts flailed them.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page  one  headlines  in  the  New  York  Times  immediately  decried  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Orgy  of  Jew-baiting."  The  article  described  sadistic  cruelties  calculated  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">coerce  Jews  into  immediately  emigrating  penniless  to  anywhere.  "In  Vienna </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Austria," the New York Times declared, "no vestige of decency or human- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ity  has  checked  the  will  to  destroy,  and  there  has  been  an  unbroken  orgy  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew-baiting  such  as  Europe  has  not  known  since  the  darkest  days  of  the  Mid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dle Ages."11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  came  the  arrests.  Thousands  of  Jews  were  extracted  from  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">homes  and  offices,  loaded  onto  wagons,  and  shipped  to  concentration  camps, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  Dachau,  where  they  suffered  bestial  tortures,  starvation,  and  back- </p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking  labor.  The  camps,  too,  were  designed  to  convince  Austrian  Jews  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">leave  the  country—should  they  ever  be  released  from  incarceration.  And  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">those who promised to emigrate at once were even considered for release.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the pace of emigration was not quick enough, Jews in the Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trian provinces were simply expelled from their homes with no notice. More </p>
<p class="calibre1">than 3,000 Jewish men, women, an d   children in the Burgenland region of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austria, many with roots dating back centuries, were loaded onto trucks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">driven to the Jewish quarter of Vienna, and summarily dumped. The Vienna </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish community housed them in synagogues and other buildings as best </p>
<p class="calibre1">they could, but the weather was unusually cold and many of the children </p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered extreme exposure and near starvation from the ordeal.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On June 30, 1938, nearly 10,000 Jewish-owned businesses in Austria </p>
<p class="calibre1">were ordered to immediately fire all Jewish employees—30,000 men and </p>
<p class="calibre1">women—and replace them with Aryans. The mass media described "heart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking scenes" across Vienna as trusted Jewish employees—many of ten- and </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-year tenure—were suddenly ousted without warning or severance.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Expulsions, exclusions, and confiscations raged across Vienna, stripping </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish citizens of their dignity, possessions, and legal status. No one was </p>
<p class="calibre1">spared.  Middle-class  Jews  from  Sigmund  Freud  to  nameless  victims  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">forced to board any ship, train, or bus out of Austria with no possessions </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  than  what  they  could  carry.15  Once  Jews  were  identified,  their  lives  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austria were over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suicide  became  a  frequent  alternative.  In  the  first  10  days  of  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">annexation,  ninety-six  persons  committed  suicide.  As  more  Jews  found  them- </p>
<p class="calibre1">selves  dispossessed  or  facing  the  prospect  of  Dachau,  they  entered  into  sui- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cide pacts and even suicide clubs.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">With stunning precision, the Nazis knew exacdy who in Austria was </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish.  Indeed,  the  New  York  Times,  in  its  initial  coverage  of  the  round-ups, </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  help  but  comment,  "Many  of  these  patrols  are  engaged  in  round- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing up the thousands on lists of those due for imprisonment and 'correction.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  lists  were  compiled  quiedy  year  after  year  in  preparation for the  day  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's seizure of power."17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  was  in  Austria.  Before  Hitler  came  to  power,  the  company  was  rep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">resented  only  by  an  agency  called  Furth  &amp;  Company,  operated  in  part  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephan  Furth.  But  in  1933,  after  Hitler  declared  the  Third  Reich,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">established  a  wholly-owned  IBM  subsidiary  in  Austria.  Furth  then  went  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  United  States  to  undergo  sales  training  with  IBM  in  New  York.  Shortly </p>
<p class="calibre1">thereafter,  Furth  returned  to  Vienna  as  co-manager  of  the  new  wholly- </p>
<p class="calibre1">owned  IBM  subsidiary.  That  subsidiary  had  the  benefit  of  one  of  IBM's  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">talented  punch  card  engineers,  Gustav  Tauschek,  and  Manager  Victor  Furth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  Dehomag-trained  manager  named  Berthold  later  joined  Furth.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">1934,  IBM  undertook  the  Austrian  census,  and  two  years  later,  Watson  ap- </p>
<p class="calibre1">proved a card printing plant for the country.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  early  1938,  in  the  weeks  leading  up  to  the  March  Anschluss,    Adolf </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eichmann was dispatched to Vienna as a specialist on Jewish affairs to organ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ize  forced  Jewish  emigration.  Once  in  Vienna,  he  found  an  enormous  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  operation  working  around  the  clock.  The  Hollerith  program  superseded </p>
<p class="calibre1">every other aspect of German preparations.19 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For  weeks  in  advance    [of  the  Anschluss],"  remembered  Eichmann </p>
<p class="calibre1">"every  able-bodied  man  they  could  find  was  put  to  work  in  three  shifts:  writ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  file  cards  for  an  enormous  circular  card  file,  several  yards  in  diameter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  a  man  sitting  on  a  piano  stool  could  operate  and  find  any  card  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted thanks to a system of punch holes. All information important for Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tria  was  entered  on  these  cards.  The  data  was  taken  from  annual  reports, </p>
<p class="calibre1">handbooks,  the  newspapers  of  all  the  political  parties,  membership  files;  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">short,  everything  imaginable.  .  .  .  Each  card  carried  name,  address,  party </p>
<p class="calibre1">membership,  whether  Jew,  Freemason  or  practicing  Catholic  or  Protestant; </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  politically  active,  whether  this  or  whether  that.  During  that  period, </p>
<p class="calibre1">our regular work was put on ice."20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  German  racial  census  scheduled  for  May  1938  was  postponed  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">year to allow Dehomag to  draw up new plans to count the population of Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tria  as  well.  Dehomag  opened  several  additional  branches  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  Reich  to  accommodate  the  extra  load.  More  than  twenty-five  offices </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  tackle  the  task  of  profiling  the  expanded  base  of  some  70  million  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mans and Austrians.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  reign  of  terror  against  the  Jews  continued  throughout  1938  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  continuing  astonishment  of  the  world.  The  final  stage  of  confiscation  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">launched  on  April  27  as  the  Reich  ordered  Jews  to  register  virtually  all  pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sessions.22 Hollerith machines were kept busy tabulating assets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conditions  in  Nazi  Germany  became  ever  more  nightmarish.  Behead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  was  adopted  as  the  dreaded  new  punishment  of  the  unappealable  Peo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ples'  Court,  which  adjudicated  in  secret  but  announced  its  executions  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world  media  as  a  warning  to  all  those  the  Reich  considered  special  enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scores  of  ghasdy  concentration  camps  were  opened  throughout  the  Greater </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich,  each  spawning  its  own  infamy  of  cruel  torture  and  degradation  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">picted  in  the  newsreels  and  magazines  of  the  day.  Mob  violence  during  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">day,  a  dreaded  knock  on  the  door  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  humiliating </p>
<p class="calibre1">public  campaigns,  and  endless  decrees  forcing  Jews  further  into  starvation </p>
<p class="calibre1">and impoverishment rained terror on Jewish existence in the Greater Reich.23 </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  revulsion  against  Germany  was  inspired  not  just  by  its  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitic outrages, but by a continuous assault of highly publicized oppression </p>
<p class="calibre1">against  Catholics,  Protestant  church groups,  intellectuals, and others the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis did not agree with.24 Hitler's war menacing clearly identified Czecho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">slovakia for imminent takeover.  Poland and France seemed next. Many </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought it was just a matter of time before Europe re-ignited into a total war </p>
<p class="calibre1">that America would be compelled to enter. It became increasingly hard for </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone to argue Germany's case, even euphemistically in code. Then came </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  turning  point  for  Americans  and  indeed  the  world:  Kristallnacht—The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Night of the Broken Glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  10,  1938,  on  the  twentieth  anniversary  of  Germany's  sur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">render in the Great War, all Germany exploded into a national pogrom of </p>
<p class="calibre1">depravity and violence against Jews heretofore not seen. The Reich's pretext </p>
<p class="calibre1">was the assassination of a German consular official in Paris by a despondent </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish refugee. Within hours of the news, disciplined cadres of shock troops </p>
<p class="calibre1">driving in open cars, directed by uniformed SA leaders, with merciless syn- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chony, deployed in virtually every town and city of the Third Reich during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the early hours. Almost on cue, Hitler's Germany erupted into a tempest of </p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered glass. Store panes, display cases, fixtures, office doors, and ordinary </p>
<p class="calibre1">windows—if it was glass, the Nazis smashed it. Synagogues, cafes, schools, </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices, homes—wherever there was unexcised Jewish presence, the Brown </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shirts, struck.25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  Jewish  possessions  were  systematically  ripped,  splattered,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">looted.  Brown  Shirts  spread  Torahs  across  the  ground  and  danced  upon  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">scrolls.  Furniture  was  thrown  into  the  street.  Valuables  were  carted  away  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">trophies. Pictures, books, and curtains were torn.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kerosene  came  next.  Floors  and  drapes  were  methodically  doused.  An </p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiastic  drenching  was  reserved  for  Torahs,  prayer  shawls,  holy  books, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  devotional  bimahs  in  synagogues.  Tossed  matches.  Rolled  incendiary </p>
<p class="calibre1">bombs.  Lobbed  petrol  bombs.  Nearly  everything  Jewish  was  set  aflame.  Not </p>
<p class="calibre1">just in Berlin. Not just in Vienna. In every town and city of the Third Reich.27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  15,000  Jews  dragged  from  their  homes  were  brutalized </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  the  cheering  onlookers,  herded  into  trucks,  dispatched  to  jails,  and  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  cases,  direcdy  to  concentration  camps.  Firemen  watched  the  flames </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  laughter,  taking  care  that  neighboring  Aryan  structures  were  unaffected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Policemen  studiously  directed  traffic,  allowing  the  marauders  complete  free- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dom of operation.28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here among the ruins was the final overnight summary of Jewish exist- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ence in Germany and a prophecy for their bleak fate in Europe. Jewish life </p>
<p class="calibre1">would ultimately be incinerated everywhere. The consequences of identifica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion had been irrevocably unmasked. Whatever doubt the world had about </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  intentions  of  the  Hitler  regime,  that  doubt  vaporized  with  the  curls  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke rising from hundreds of synagogues and Jewish offices in Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newspapers,  newsreels,  a n d   radio  broadcasts  across  the  globe  burned </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  headlines  condemning  Hitler's  Reich  as  savage  and  barbarous.  The  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  Times  printed  a  tall  page  one  banner  headline:  "Nazis  Smash,  Loot  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burn  Jewish  Shops  and  Temples."  The  newspaper  tellingly  noted  that  tin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  Vienna  synagogue  not  torched  was  one  "that  the  authorities  have  pro </p>
<p class="calibre1">tected  .  .  .  because  it  contains  records  of  the  Jewish  community  of  Vienna </p>
<p class="calibre1">that could not be replaced."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington  recalled  its  ambassador  from  Berlin.  Western  diplomats </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  for  concerted  action  to  stem  the  anti-Semitic  outrages.  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  issued  a  sharply  worded  denunciation  in  which  he  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonally  penned  the  words,  "I  myself  could  scarcely  believe  that  such  tilings </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  occur  in  a  twentieth  century  civilization."  Gallup  Polls  asked  whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  could  be  believed  when  he  said  he  had  no  more  territorial  ambitions </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Europe  beyond  Czechoslovakia;  92  percent  of  American  respondents  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">93  percent  of  British  respondents  declared  Hitler  could  not  be  believed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  followers  in  America  had  already  been  prosecuted  in  high-profile </p>
<p class="calibre1">cases  under  various  civil  rights  statutes.  Now,  the  term  "Nazi  sympathizer" </p>
<p class="calibre1">became  widely  used.  And  Nazi  collaboration  and  propagandizing  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">deemed  sufficiently  subversive  and  "un-American"  that  eventually  a  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congressional committee investigated.30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">American  reaction  to  the  riots  was  almost  wholly  disregarded  by  Hitler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Kristallnacht,  Jews  were  forced  to  vacate  their  apartments,  sometimes </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  just  a  few  days'  notice,  as  Hitler  loyalists  queued  up  to  move  in.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">Munich,  all  Jewish  families  were  given  just  forty-eight  hours  to  permanently </p>
<p class="calibre1">leave  the  city.  The  order  was  soon  rescinded  as  impossible—although  later </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  demand  was  re-imposed.  Jews  were  collectively  fined  1  billion  marks  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">inciting  the  Kristallnacht  riots.  And  the  last  phases  of  confiscation  and  asset </p>
<p class="calibre1">registration were set in motion.31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  German  government  issued  dire  warning  after  dire  warning  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  situation  could  worsen.  But  a  New  York  Times  feature  on  November  14, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938,  ominously  asked,  "Inasmuch  as  everything  has  been  done  to  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Germany  that  can  be  done  to  a  people  short  of  physical  extermination, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  are  arising  some  obvious  speculations  as  to  what  these  continued  warn- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ings may imply." The question was answered just days later on November 30, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when the newspaper published an article headlined "Jews in Germany Get </p>
<p class="calibre1">Extermination  Threat,"    quoting  the  Schwarze  Korps,  the  organ  of  Hitler's  SS, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as it advertised the potential for wholesale Jewish murder.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  had  visited  Germany  twice  in  1938,  once  in  late  May,  just  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Anschluss of Austria, and once in early October, during the tense build-up </p>
<p class="calibre1">to Kristallnacht.33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  was  threatening  invasion  daily.  War  preparations  were  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret. Reich propagandists spread the word, ensuring headlines and de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bates. Commanders fortified borders. Mobilization plans were disseminated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aircraft engineers received special awards for new bomber and fighter </p>
<p class="calibre1">designs. Passenger trains were restricted so rail stock could be devoted to </p>
<p class="calibre1">troop movements. Housewives were publicly asked to dramatically reduce </p>
<p class="calibre1">consumption  of  fats  to  save  money  so  the  Reich  could  purchase  raw  materi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">als urgently needed for its weapons production.34 War was in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet, throughout the year, Watson argued passionately for Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">demands.  He  barely  made  an  appearance  at  an  international  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting, university commencement ceremony, ribbon-cutting, or press con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ference without reiterating his well-worn Hitleresque appeal that the world </p>
<p class="calibre1">"redistribute its raw materials" and lower so-called "trade barriers" as "the </p>
<p class="calibre1">path to peace." This public lobbying was undertaken even as the mass media </p>
<p class="calibre1">regularly published articles and broadcast explanations that Germany des- </p>
<p class="calibre1">perately only needed those raw materials to arm her war machine. Even </p>
<p class="calibre1">though Watson's pronouncements sounded to many as mere code for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi agenda, he held fast to his script. More than that, whenever Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned from a tour of the Continent, his dockside remarks always spoke </p>
<p class="calibre1">glowingly of the optimism throughout Europe and the steadily increased </p>
<p class="calibre1">standard of living for all—this at a time when the world was teetering on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">brink of total war and witnessing the dispossession of the Jews.35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prominent writers and personalities would rebut Watson's brand of </p>
<p class="calibre1">t h i n k i n g .  One foreign correspondent in the New York Times reflected the </p>
<p class="calibre1">common view when he wrote, "It must be remembered . . . the series of boy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cotts due to worldwide resentment against German domestic policies ... play </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost as large a part as do the trade barriers." In May 1938, just after the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anschluss and just before sailing to Germany, Watson answered such senti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments. "Unjust criticism of business is a trade barrier," he lectured his fellow </p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialists at an ICC gathering, adding, "Unjust criticism of government is </p>
<p class="calibre1">another trade barrier."36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Watson,  whatever  Hitler  was  doing  to  the  Jews  and  other  perceived </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemies of the Third Reich was no obstacle to realizing profit on Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">plans. "You know, you can cooperate w i t h  a man without believing in every- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing  he  says  and  does,"  Watson  sermonized  to  his  followers  after  one  trip  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  adding,  "If  you  do  not  agree  with  everything  he  does,  cooperate </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  him  in  the  things  you  do  believe  in.  Others  will  cooperate  with  him  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  things  they  believe  in."  On  another  occasion,  Watson  illuminated  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">steeled indifference this way: "I am an American citizen. But in the IBM I am </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  world  citizen,  because  we  do  business  in  78  countries  and  they  all  look </p>
<p class="calibre1">alike to me—every one of them."37 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet  when  Watson's  ocean  liner  anchored  at  New  York  just  days  after  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  10  Kristallnacht  outrage,  it  was  all  different.  IBM's  Leader  finally </p>
<p class="calibre1">realized  that  American  sentiment  had  become  so  extremely  anti-Nazi,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">now  needed  to  distance  himself  from  the  very  regime  he  had  so  publicly </p>
<p class="calibre1">saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOVEMBER 2,5, 1938 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Hjalmar Schacht </p>
<p class="calibre1">President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reichsbank </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin, Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Dr. Schacht: </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  returned  from  Europe  about  ten  days  ago,  and  I  feel  I  owe  it  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  and  the  German  people  to  tell  you  of  the  tremendous  loss  of  good </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  to  Germany,  which  is  increasing  on  account  of  the  latest  policies  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  in  regard  to  dealing  with  Jewish  minorities  in  your  country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  feel  that  I  would  be  unfair  to  my  long  list  of  Jewish  friends  if  I  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  appeal  to  your  Government  to  give  fair  consideration  to  the  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  human  beings,  and  to  their  property  rights.  As  you  know,  for  many </p>
<p class="calibre1">years,  I  have  put  forth  my  best  efforts  to  improve  trade  relations </p>
<p class="calibre1">between  Germany  and  the  United  States,  and  I  want  you  to  know  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  is  my  honest  judgment  that  if  the  Jewish  situation  today  is  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">improved,  it  will  have  a  very  serious  effect  on  Germany's  trade  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">our country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yours very truly38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  reviewed  the  typed  letter  from  his  secretary.  A  diagonal  line  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn  through  the  entire  letter  canceling  its  message  and  the  words  "Yours </p>
<p class="calibre1">very  truly"  were  vigorously  crossed  out.  The  letter  would  not  be  sent.39  Sec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ond try, this one directly to Adolf Hitler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOVEMBER 25, 1938 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your Excellency: </p>
<p class="calibre1">In </p>

<p class="calibre1">of </p>

<p class="calibre1">Eagle,  which  was  presented  to  me  by  Dr.  Schacht  on  behalf  of  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  Government,  in  recognition  of  my  efforts  for  world  peace,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">better economic relations between Germany and other nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  expressing  my  thanks  to  you,  I  stated  that  I  would  cooperate  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  in  the  future  as  I  had  in  the  past  in  connection  with  these  two </p>
<p class="calibre1">important  issues.  This,  I  am  still  most  anxious  to  do;  but  upon  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">recent  return  to  my  country  after  an  absence  of  several  months  I  find  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">change  in  public  sentiment  and  a  loss  of  good  will  to  your  country,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">unless  something  can  be  done  to  bring  about  a  more  friendly  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing  on  the  part  of  our  people,  I  feel  it  is  going  to  be  difficult  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplish  mutually  satisfactory  results  in  connection  with  our  trade </p>
<p class="calibre1">relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The </p>
<p class="calibre1">change </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">sentiment </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred </p>

<p class="calibre1">and  I  respectfully  appeal  to  you  to  give  consideration  to  applying  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden Rule in dealing with these minorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  have  read  with  the  greatest  interest  the  statement  that  your  Gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment  is  prepared  to  make  arrangements  with  a  committee  of  lead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  Quakers  to  assist  German  Jews  in  the  spirit  of  charity  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden  Rule,  I  venture,  therefore,  to  accept  this  act  as  a  symbol  of  will- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ingness on your part to grant more generous treatment to minorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  your  Excellency  would  follow  up  this  act  of  kindliness  with  poli- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cies  inspired  by  its  humanitarian  effort,  it  would,  in  my  opinion,  be  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  way  by  which  those  interested  in  the  exchange  of  goods  and  serv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ices  and  high  ideals  might  find  the  opportunity  to  help  Germany  regain </p>
<p class="calibre1">the valuable trade and good-will which she has lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very respectfully yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Watson40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  be  able  to  show  his  direct  and  unequivocal  protest  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  anyone  as  evidence  of  vociferous  objection  to  Hitler's  anti-Semitism.  Pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sumably  the  letter  could  be  exhibited  with  the  same  flourish  Watson  em- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ployed  in  displaying  other  letters  to  and  from  world  leaders,  some  of  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">he routinely carried in his inside suit pocket. Surely, the November 25, 1938, </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  would  put  Watson  on  record  as  unalterably  opposed  to  Hitler's  cam- </p>
<p class="calibre1">paign.  But    somehow,  Watson's  explicit  letter  to  Hitler  was  .  .  .  misaddressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  could  always  say  it  had  been  mailed.  But  in  truth  the  Post  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned it—unopened. Watson's secretary tried again four months later.41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  of  conscience  throughout  the  world  were  outraged  at  the  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">regime.  Yet  Germany  was  on  the  verge  of  expanding  its  use  of  Hollerith  sys- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tems  to  an  unprecedented  level.  Watson  needed  to  cover  himself  in  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  at  home.  He  would  now  pursue  a  strange  public  posture,  essentially </p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking  from  both  sides  of  the  punch  card.  Deftly,  he  would  mix  his  mes- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sages  of  subtle  advocacy  for  Reich  territorial  and  economic  hegemony  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">patriotic  assertions  supporting  American  defense  measures,  and  almost  polly- </p>
<p class="calibre1">annaish  aphorisms  offered  to  Germany  about  its  brutal  anti-Semitism.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  would  always  be  able  to  point  to  out-of-context  portions  of  his  remarks </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  satisfy  any  audience—be  it  those  listening  in  the  Nazi  Reich  or  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States.  At  the  same  time,  all  mention  of  Germany  as  the  linchpin  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">overseas operation was conspicuously dropped from IBM press statements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  just  after  Kristallnacht,  when  Watson  returned  from  Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his  usual  dockside  remarks  to  the  media  listed  the  many  countries  he  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">visited,  including  Greece,  Italy,  Romania,  Portugal,  Turkey,  and  France.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  was  not  mentioned—the  first  time  since  the  rise  of  Hitler  that  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  had  omitted  the  country  name  from  his  proudly  detailed  itineraries.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspaper  article  about  IBM's  foreign  employees  studying  at  the  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales  school  in  Endicott  spoke  of  students  from  twenty-four  countries.  Yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's  name  was  the  only  one  not  listed—again, the first  time  the  Reich's </p>
<p class="calibre1">place  in  IBM's  international  commerce  was  omitted,  even  though,  as  usual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">representatives from Germany were there.42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Platitudes  were  dispensed  in  abundance.  "World  Peace  through  World </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trade"  became  Watson's  official  jingo  to  explain  away  IBM  trading  with  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany.  Beckoning  Hitler  to  please  "observe  the  Golden  Rule"  paled  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">schoolboy-like  admonishment  in  the  face  of  the  ruthless  torture  and  dispos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">session  gripping  German  Jewry.  But  Watson  was  an  expert  at  calculated  pub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lic  pronouncements  on  troublesome  topics.  When  he  first  assumed  the  helm </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  IBM  organization—back  in  the  CTR  days—he  scheduled  a  company </p>
<p class="calibre1">assembly  to  demonstratively  and  publicly  lecture  his  sales  force,  "You  must </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  do  anything  that's  in  restraint  of  trade  . . .   or  that  could  be  construed  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">anybody  as  unfair  competition."  Ironically,  these  stern  moralistic  directives </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  conspicuously  broadcast  just  at  the  height  of  the  Justice  Department's </p>
<p class="calibre1">decision-making  process  on  re-prosecuting  Watson  for  his  role  in  one  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">America's most aggravated cases of anti-competitive tactics.43 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,  at  the  same  time  the  IBM  Leader  was  advocating  "the  Golden </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rule," he wrote a letter to the world's governments urging them to "collabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  regardless  of  divergent  ideals  and  opinions"  to  avoid  war.  In  interna- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional economic forums, he asserted "the divine right of every people to </p>
<p class="calibre1">choose its own government" and demanded "adjustments that would give all </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries an opportunity to share in the resources of the world."44 Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">choice  of  words  bore  the  unmistakable  ring  of  Germany's  party  line,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">likewise  demanded  that  it  be  allowed  to  share  in  all  of  Europe's  natural </p>
<p class="calibre1">resources </p>
<p class="calibre1">for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">greater </p>
<p class="calibre1">glory </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  Watson's  public  posturing  stopped  him  from  accelerating </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  ability  to  do  Hitler's  bidding  throughout  Europe—so  long  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  could  keep  its  distance  and  Watson  could  remain  removed  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">process.  In  late  May  1938,  shortly  after  Germany  annexed  Austria,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">visited  Berlin  on  Dehomag  business.  Watson  requested  Dehomag's  manage- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  to  prepare  to  extend  its  operations  into  Austria,  thus  replacing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">existing  subsidiary  controlled  by  IBM  NY.  Dehomag  was  going  to  develop </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  unique  tabulating  equipment,  based  on  its  powerful  new  D-11,  engi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">neered    for  special  applications  that  could  generate  significant  revenues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  these  new  efforts  would  have  an  impact  on  complicated  issues  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">profit  sharing,  tax,  bonus,  and  general  compensation—all  of  which  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted carefully negotiated.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More and more, Watson tried to work through intermediaries. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiation itself was delayed until shortly after Watson left Germany. Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on the morning of June 24, 1938, Dehomag convened a shareholder meeting </p>
<p class="calibre1">attended  by  two  Geneva-based  IBM  executives  representing  the  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">office. Although Watson was not there, he controlled the decisions from afar </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  his  85  percent  vote,  cast  through  his  European  General  Manager </p>
<p class="calibre1">John E. Holt who held a power-of-attorney. Point six of the minutes called </p>
<p class="calibre1">for negotiations "as soon as possible."46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was left to a member of the IBM NY's board of directors, Oscar L. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gubelman, to work out the details of Dehomag's expansion into Austria, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along with certain loan provisions and stock options as inducements for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag Directors Rottke and Hummel. Gubelman agreed that the direc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors' loan provisions and stock options could be incorporated into a formal </p>
<p class="calibre1">supplemental employment contract, but the Austrian expansion itself was to </p>
<p class="calibre1">be kept as an oral arrangement recorded only by memo. On July 6, 1938, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke and Hummel jointly confirmed the oral arrangement in a letter to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gubelman, who was staying at Berlin's Hotel Adlon. Their letter listed three </p>
<p class="calibre1">main points: "a) New Products, b) New Territories, c) reduction of [stock] </p>
<p class="calibre1">repurchase  price  in  case  of  premature  leaving  the  Dehomag  due  to  notice  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">resignation."47 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  j o i n t   Dehomag  l et t er   acknowledged  New  York's  primacy  in  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain  terms.  "IBM,"  the  letter  emphasized,  retains  "unlimited  power  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">dispose  of  such  new  products,  and  in  view  of  its  [IBM's]  position  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag,  is  absolutely  in  a  position,  even  without  our  express  declaration  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">assent,  on  its  part  to  formulate  the  conditions  for  the  inclusion  of  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">in such new business."48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  IBM  NY  could  authorize  Dehomag  to  develop  new  products  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">expand  into  Austria,  but  if  it  did  so,  the  business  would  be  maintained  sepa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rately  from  the  regular  books  and  would  appear  instead  as  loan  or  bonus </p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions.  Dehomag's  confirmation  letter  expressed  the  understanding  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">cautious,  stilted  language.  For  New  Products:  "It  has  been  orally  agreed,"  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  recited,  "and  is  confirmed  herewith  by  us  in  writing,  in  case  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">entrusts  Dehomag  with  the  sale  and/or  manufacture  of  new  products  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">lie  outside  the  present  scope  of  business  of  the  Dehomag  and  also  do  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">come  under  the  license  agreement  between  the  Dehomag  and  the  IBM,  we </p>
<p class="calibre1">agree  that  upon  the  request  of  the  IBM,  we  can  be  totally  or  partly  excluded </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  results  of  the  business  transactions  in  these  new  products,  as  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  agreed  upon  in  the  form  of  a  bonus  in  the  loan  agreements  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">supplementary agreements concluded between the Dehomag and us."49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  New  Territories:  "In  case  the  IBM  should  voluntarily  transfer  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">working  of  territories  outside  of  Germany  to  the  Dehomag,  we  also  agree </p>
<p class="calibre1">that,  upon  the  request  of  the  IBM,  we  can  be  totally  or  partly  excluded  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  results  of  the  business  transactions  in  these  new  territories  as  they  have </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  agreed  upon  in  the  form  of  a  bonus  in  the  loan  agreements  and  supple- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mentary agreements concluded between the Dehomag and us."50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  letter  added,  "After  careful  deliberation,  you  have  considered  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">proper  to  let  the  points  a)  [New  Products]  and  b)  [New  Territories]  be  dealt </p>
<p class="calibre1">with merely in this letter in the sense of our discussion, while point c) will be </p>
<p class="calibre1">included  in  the  supplementary  agreement."  Rottke  and  Hummel's  letter  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cluded  with  their  gratitude  for  helping  the  Reich:  "We  confidently  hope  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  contents  of  this  letter  will  convince  Mr.  Watson  .  .  .  that  we  see  our  life's </p>
<p class="calibre1">task  in  our  present  work  and  sincerely  wish  to  contribute  to  the  development </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Dehomag  for  many  years  to  come.  We  thank  you  very  much  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">great assistance you have given in this matter."51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  arrangement  to  expand  Dehomag  was  handled  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">intermediaries,  Watson  micro-managed  every  detail. On  August  2,  1938, Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son sent a letter to John Holt, IBM's European general manager, confirming </p>
<p class="calibre1">approval of both the loan additions to the employment contracts and the spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cial letter about the expansion. "Mr. Gubelman has handed me the final draft </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the proposed amendment to the Rottke-Hummel contracts," wrote Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son, "and also the letter from Rottke-Hummel addressed to Mr. Gubelman as </p>
<p class="calibre1">a Director, dated July 6, 1938..,. You are authorized to sign for IBM."52 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene was set for Dehomag to immediately expand into every new </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-conquered nation, so long as IBM approved in advance. Austria was </p>
<p class="calibre1">only the beginning, and IBM understood it well. On August 4, 1938, J.C. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Milner, a Geneva-based IBM supervisor of Dehomag, wrote to J. T. Wilson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  manager  of  IBM  NY's  so-called  Foreign  Division,  explaining,  "Rottke  has </p>
<p class="calibre1">made arrangements . . . which include equipment for seven or eight different </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries to fill customers orders." The letter added that Dehomag could not </p>
<p class="calibre1">fill all the orders from its inventory, so "five or six sets of Valtat equipment </p>
<p class="calibre1">... we shall have shipped [from the U.S.] to the freeport at Geneva."53 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A key mission for Dehomag machines was census in neighboring coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries. "During 1940, the census will be taken in several countries," Milner's </p>
<p class="calibre1">August 4 letter confirmed, "and we expect a number of orders." He added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One of the problems which confronts  us  is  that of providing  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines for census work. . . . Since Endicott has discontinued manufactur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing the Printing Counting Sorter, we do not seem to have any machine par- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ticularly adapted to census work. As you know, Germany does construct a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Census  Tabulator,  and  we  have  always  figured  on  being  able  to  get  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines from them for forthcoming work." But production in Germany was </p>
<p class="calibre1">backlogged  and  was  becoming  less  economical  because  of  Reich  currency </p>
<p class="calibre1">restrictions.54 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  Milner  wondered  whether  Endicott  wanted  to  develop  its  own  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus  tabulator  capable  of  high-speed  counting,  continue  to  rely  on  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  version,  or  perhaps  produce  them  in  another  European  country  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">ship them on Dehomag's behalf. "If Endicott does not propose to undertake </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  work,"  he  wrote  in  the  August  4,  1938,  letter,  "it  is  quite  possible  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">we shall have to look into the situation in France, and see whether they can </p>
<p class="calibre1">economically  construct  a  machine  equivalent  to  the  German  Census  Tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lator."55  IBM  NY  now  began  viewing  its  various  subsidiaries  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe as coordinated to support Dehomag's operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, IBM NY wanted to maintain strict controls on each and </p>
<p class="calibre1">every Dehomag lease. Special rebates and discounts for Reich operations </p>
<p class="calibre1">could not be extended unless approved by New York. J. T. Wilson sent a </p>
<p class="calibre1">memo to IBM's Europe headquarters on August 25, 1938, entitled "Ship- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment of German Machines Beyond Germany," demanding to know whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate  controller  in  Geneva  were  setting  prices  for  machines  shipped </p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond  the  bolders  of  Germany.  W i l s o n   wanted  to  make  sure  the  proper </p>
<p class="calibre1">mark-up  above  coil  was  preserved.  That  same  day  he  sent  a  second  letter  off </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Harrison  Chauncey,  another  IBM  NY  management  troubleshooter  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe,  explaining,  "Their  costs  are  very  much  higher  than  our  costs  at  Endi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cott. For instance, the cost of building a Sorter in Germany is $292, while the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cost at Endicott is $220."56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holt  replied  to  Wilson,  "We  have  a  fixed  charge  ...  and  do  not  take  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration  whether  it  comes  from  the  United  States,  or  Germany,  or </p>
<p class="calibre1">another  factory."  He  added,  however,  that  "in  the  case  of  special  machines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  [Dehomag's]  D-11,  we  have  always  set  prices  which  are,  we  believe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat  higher  than  the  United  States  would  charge...  .  Since  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  has  a  schedule  of  rebates  to  its  customers  of  which  you  are  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware,  in  taking  a  special  German  machine  and  placing  it  in  a  foreign  coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">try,  we  have  always  tried  to  approach  the  net  German  price,  using  the  official </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate of exchange."57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holt  offered  an  example.  "In  other  words,"  he  wrote,  "should  a  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  supplied  to  Holland,  we  would  .  .  .  add  25%,  and  [then]  add  a  further </p>
<p class="calibre1">10%."  But  Holt  made  unequivocally  clear  that  IBM  NY  controlled  pricing  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  of  Germany's  machines.  "[I]n  all  cases,  we  set  the  prices,  and  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">does not."58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Complicating  all  IBM  efforts  to  profit  on  Dehomag's  Europe-wide  sales </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  fall  1938  was  yet  another  Reich  monetary  decree.  Germany  was  nearing </p>
<p class="calibre1">bankruptcy.  The  anti-Nazi  boycott  had  virtually  crippled  a  once-thriving </p>
<p class="calibre1">export-dependent  Reich  economy.  Despite  desperate  cashless  barter  efforts </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  boost  foreign  sales  and  unverifiable  trade  statistics  to  the  contrary,  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many's  currency-earning  exports  were  down  to  the  United  States  by  as  much </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  95  percent  for  many  commercial  sectors.  Schacht  had  confided  as  much </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Watson  at  the  1937  ICC  Congress.59  Without  foreign  exchange,  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  rearm.  So  it  was  hardly  a  surprise  to  IBM  when  the  Third  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">prohibited  exports  by  German  companies  unless  they  earned  actual  cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  Dehomag  could  no  longer  ship  Hollerith  machines  across </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  borders  and  then  forward  the  sales  income  to  IBM  NY  as  so-called  debt </p>
<p class="calibre1">repayment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As  you  are  aware,"  IBM's  Milner  in  Geneva  wrote  Wilson  in  New  York, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  an  early  August  1938  letter,  "for  a  number  of  years  we  have  been  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">charge such goods against the debts owing to IBM in New York, but this per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mission  has  now  been  withdrawn  by  the  Government."  Milner  added  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangement was a surprise even to IBM auditors. "Price Waterhouse people </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Berlin...  stated  it  was  most  unusual  and  they  did  not  know  of  any  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign concern who had the same privilege."60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, "I'm sorry to tell you,"  M i l n e r  lamented, "that we have </p>
<p class="calibre1">just been advised by Mr. Rottke that from now on it will not be possible to </p>
<p class="calibre1">ship tabulating equipment and other goods out of Germany to our various </p>
<p class="calibre1">countries without the German company receiving payment for the goods."61 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, profits would not only be trapped in German blocked mark ac- </p>
<p class="calibre1">counts, other IBM subsidiaries in Europe acting as intermediaries for Deho- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mag would have to transfer foreign currency to Berlin to complete the </p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  Dehomag  income  in  Europe,  unless  somehow  shrouded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  now  subject  IBM  profits  to  double  taxation.  Double  taxation  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">particular  irritant  to  Watson,  and  he  had  worked  for  years  to  legislate  a  solu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  IBM  Geneva's  M.  G.  Connally,  a  key  Dehomag  auditor,  revealed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company's  attitude  to  a  U.S.  State  Department  officer  earlier  in  1938.  He  let </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  slip  that  "some  concerns  have  actually  resorted  to  the  fiction  of  royalties  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">order  to avoid  taxation,"  but  quickly  added, that  in the  case  of  IBM,  "no such </p>
<p class="calibre1">fiction  existed  and  that  royalties  are  the  result  of  clearly  worded  contracts."62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  just    controlling  which  machines    would  be    distributed </p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  Europe,  and  at  what  price,  IBM  understood  by  fall  1938  that  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  now  an  integral  part  of  the  Nazi  war  machine.  Wilson  circulated  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">August  25,  1938,  a  memo  to  senior  management  in  the  New  York  office, </p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewing  problems  in  exporting  machines  from  Germany.  "As  you  know," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilson  informed,  "both  brass  and  copper  and  alloys  play  a  big  part  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism  of  all  of  our  machines  and  these  metals  are  very  scarce  in  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many, at least, I am told they require them for war materials."63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  by  1937,  the  Reich  concluded  that  punch  card  technology  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">too  important  to  its  plan  for  Europe  not  to  be  strictly  regulated.  Henceforth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  would  be  rationed  only  to  those  users  approved  by  the  military.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">1937,  a  secret  unit  was created  within the  Reich  War Ministry's  Office  of  Mili- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tary  Economy.  The  department  became  known  under  the  innocuous  name </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maschinelles  Berichtwesen,  or  Office  of  Automated  Reporting,  and  was  dedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cated    to  one  main  function:  punch  card  technology.  This  agency  went </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  several  bureaucratic  metamorphoses,  chiefly  through  the  Reich  Min- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istry for Armaments and War Production. The Maschinelles Berichtwesen, also </p>
<p class="calibre1">known  as  the  MB,  wielded  complete  control  over  the  ordering,  sale,  use, </p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting,  and  coordination  of  all  Hollerith  systems  in  Greater  Germany.  It </p>
<p class="calibre1">worked  in  complete  tandem  with  all  aspects  of  Hitler's  campaigns  in  Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opening so-called "field offices" in conquered countries.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the Reich's point fo view, punch card technology would be indis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pensable  to  its  war-making  capability.  A  February  1938  secret  military  report </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared  that  "technologizing  t h e   Wehrniacht  [armed  forces]"  was  impera- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tive.  The  report  listed  the  continual  regimentation,  tracking,  and  redeploy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment  of  the  general  population,  work  force,  and  military  personnel,  as  best </p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplished  by  Hollerith  systems.  "A  punch  card  system,"  the  MB  report </p>
<p class="calibre1">concluded,  "must  be  introduced  for  the  statistical  survey  of  workers  and  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">shifting workers" to create "perfectly structured personnel planning."65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  later  memo  from  the  Office  of  Military  Economy  called  for  a  universal </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  code  system.  The  document  reviewed  Dehomag's  many  prior  efforts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  the  census,  labor  statistics,  and  the  Work  Book,  but  that  these  "all </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  the  disadvantage  of  existing  for  singular  purposes  and  being  incompati- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ble  with  each  other." The report  made  clear,  "it  is impossible to reliably  sepa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  industrial  demand  for  armament  purposes  from  total  industrial  demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  punch  card  is  appropriate  for  the  solution  of  this  problem,"  adding,  "The </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  does  not  replace  all  considerations,  judgments  and  decisions,  but </p>
<p class="calibre1">it makes them easier."66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  it  was  obvious  to  all  that  Germany  was  preparing  for  imminent </p>
<p class="calibre1">war,  it  was  also  apparent  that  the  Reich  was  aggressively  utilizing  statistics </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  punch  card  technology  to  track  Jews  and  implement  its  program  of  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">secution.  "Statistics  issued  today  show  that  12,094  Jews  left  Berlin  last  year </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  Palestine,  Great  Britain  and  the  Americas,"  led  a  July  4,  1937,  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Times  article datelined  Berlin,  adding,  "The  statistics are confined  to  'Jews by </p>
<p class="calibre1">faith,'  the  authorities  declaring  that  Jews  by  race  alone  could  be  included  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  records."  Wire  services  regularly  reported  on  the  facts  of  Nazi  demo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">graphic  tracking:  religion  percentages  based  on  census  returns;  quotas  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">goods  Jews  could  purchase;  an  August  17,  1938,  regulation  compelling  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified  Jews  whose  names  did  not  "sound  Jewish"  to  add  the  first  name </p>
<p class="calibre1">Israel or Sara.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newspapers,  on  May  15,  1938,  listed  a  number  of  large  cities  outside </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  and  exactly  how  much  their  Jewish  population  had  decreased  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  end  of  1937.  Nuremberg  had  7,502 Jews in  1933,  but  only  4,000  in  1937. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worms  went  from  1,016  Jews  in  1933  to  549  in  1937.  Hagen  dropped  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">508 to 299.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi  raceology  was  becoming  an  all  encompassing  obsession  evident </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  virtually  every  street  and  within  every  organization  in  Germany.  A  June </p>
<p class="calibre1">22, 1938, New York Times article reported, "twenty-six research organizations </p>
<p class="calibre1">have been established throughout the Reich which go from family to family" </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  identify  bloodline.  Wire  services  informed  that  the  curriculum  for  all  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  medical  students  had  been  altered  to  include  mandatory  courses  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">race  science  and  population  policy.  Local  prosecutors  could  order  compul- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sory  divorces  of  Jews  and  Aryans.  At  the  same  time,  hundreds  of  thousands </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  marriages  of  urban  Aryan  women  to  what  the  Germans  termed  "virile, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hereditary"  farmers  were  required  by  Nazi  demographers  to  achieve  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion  health;  the  authorities  began  combing  factories  and  offices  for  state- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mandated  brides.69  Few  in  America  outside  of  IBM  understood  that  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">highly  publicized  racial  policies  were  facilitated  by  Dehomag's  population, </p>
<p class="calibre1">health office, and labor office tabulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personal data that could not be tabulated by an organization for lack of </p>
<p class="calibre1">an on-site Hollerith system were assembled on simple handwritten cards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms, or copied onto registries that were forwarded to race offices and secu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rity services for punching and sorting. Churches were among the leading </p>
<p class="calibre1">sources of such information. Their antique, ornately bound church books </p>
<p class="calibre1">were often bulky and difficult to work with so supply companies developed a </p>
<p class="calibre1">variety of index cards in various sizes designed to facilitate the tracing of </p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestry. Often the process was awkward and anything but fast.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">One small church office in Braunlage in the Harz Mountains was typical </p>
<p class="calibre1">when it complained in a letter to the Reichssippenamt, the Reich's leading </p>
<p class="calibre1">raceology agency, that the cards were too small and the data too large. "We </p>
<p class="calibre1">have received samples of cards for the carding of church books," wrote Pas- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tor Stich. "Once we started to work with these cards, we noticed that these </p>
<p class="calibre1">are rather small. . . . For [those of] us who are doing the work and bearing </p>
<p class="calibre1">the costs, it is important we record not just some of the data, but all of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">data, so that each card gives complete information about ancestry. ... we are </p>
<p class="calibre1">not served well if we have to open and move the pages of the heavy and irre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">placeable church books." Pastor Stich asked for larger index cards, making </p>
<p class="calibre1">clear, "We are glad to serve the cause ... and ready to do the job right."71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reichssippenamt prompdy replied, 'The primary function of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">carding of church books is that it makes the research easier and at the same </p>
<p class="calibre1">time preserves the church book. . . . if you follow my guidelines for an alpha- </p>
<p class="calibre1">betical name index then use of the church books itself should be reduced by </p>
<p class="calibre1">a factor of fifty."72 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Local NSDAP leadership in Diisseldorf debated whether cards should </p>
<p class="calibre1">be filed phonetically or alphabetically. Either way, the office felt it wise to </p>
<p class="calibre1">color code the cards. "Whenever full Jews or mixed Jews appear," a local </p>
<p class="calibre1">official wrote, "the former are marked by a red line, the latter by a blue line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  both  also  receive  a  tab.  Without  the  tab,  the  red  and  blue  lines </p>
<p class="calibre1">could  otherwise  not  be  easily  identified  after  the  sorting  and  filing  has  taken </p>
<p class="calibre1">place."73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detailed  instructions  were  developed  for  recording  baptisms  to  make </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure  Jews  could  not  hide  their  identity  through  conversion.  "For  every  Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  baptism,"  the  instructions  read,  "two  double  cards  are  to  be  filled  out  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">addition  to  the  normal  card.  (One for the  Reichssippenamt and  one for  the  file </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Persons  of  Foreign  Descent  in  the  Berlin  central  office).  With  name </p>
<p class="calibre1">changes  (for  example,  the  Jew  Israel  receives  the  family  name  Leberecht </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  baptism),  the  Christian  or  Jewish  name  is  to  be  entered  in  parenthe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ses  in  the  field  for  family  name."  The  name  was  then  coded  R,  and  the  Jew's </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation and address were to be written on the reverse side.74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  help  standardize  methods,  the  Publishing  House  of  Registry  Office </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matters published a guide entitled How Do I Card Church Books?75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  precise  were  the  tabulations  that,  in  some  areas,  the  authorities  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified  people  considered  "sixteenth  Jews."  The  county  of  Bautzen,  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  summarized  its  extensive  race  tracking  in  a  December  5,  1937 </p>
<p class="calibre1">study,  bragging  that  it  had  expanded  the  local  Race  Political  Office  from  four </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  to  twenty-one  during  the  previous  two  and  a  half  years,  with  addi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional race experts deployed in local Party offices as well as women's associa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions.  "For  the  entire  county  area,"  officials  asserted,  "there  exists  a  file  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews,  Half-Jews,  Quarter-Jews,  Eighth-Jews,  etc.  with  the  following  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion:  name,  residence,  occupation,  date  of  birth,  place  of  birth,  citizenship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">religion  ..  . spouse,  children,  ancestors."  As  a  result, local  officials  had identi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fied  92  [full]  Jews,  40  half-Jews,  19  quarter-Jews,  5  eighth-Jews,  and  4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteenth-Jews "whose connections are continuously observed."76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Race  offices  developed  a  mutual  help  network  that  constandy  traded </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  updated  their  data.  For  example,  Bautzen's  information  collection  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  by  registries  from  the  State  Health  Offices;  those  offices  were  tabu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lated  by  Hollerith  systems.  In  June  1938,  339  local  labor  offices  took  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">so-called  "labor  census"  of  22,300,000  German  workers  employed  in  approx- </p>
<p class="calibre1">imately  247  occupational  groups  and  subsets;  the  labor  agencies  also </p>
<p class="calibre1">exchanged  information  assembled  by  Dehomag.  Eichmann's  office  Referat  II </p>
<p class="calibre1">112,  the  Jewish  Section  of  the  Main  Security  Office,  traded  its  synagogue </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  church  sects  lists  with  the  Reichssippenamt.,  both  offices  used  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">systems.77 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  exponential  growth  of  demand  for  Dehomag  services  spurred  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  to  push  his  entire  organization  to  manufacture  more  German  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">faster. He even pushed his German managers at Dehomag to break produc- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion records. In mid-June, Watson agreed to add equipment and work space </p>
<p class="calibre1">if the German subsidiary could double its output IBM managers in Paris </p>
<p class="calibre1">monitored Dehomag's monthly progress, and asked for hard numbers. By the </p>
<p class="calibre1">end of 1937, Rottke was able to report to IBM that monthly punch card pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duction was at 74 million per month, production of horizontal sorters would </p>
<p class="calibre1">double from 15 to 30 per month, tabulating machines would increase from </p>
<p class="calibre1">18 per month to 20 per month, multiplying punches would double from 5 to </p>
<p class="calibre1">10 per month, and counters would rise from 200 to 250 per month.78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To speed production, IBM approved the purchase of more machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">tools for the assembly shops. Three inclinable presses, a jig bore, five </p>
<p class="calibre1">6-spindle drill presses, four vertical drill presses, five bench drills, and a vari- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ety of milling machines, saws, grinders, lathes, and screw presses.79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In early June 1938, IBM again pushed for greater productivity. Holt </p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded IBM's Paris-based European Factory Manager J G. Johnston, "Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson states that you told him last year ... it should be possible to produce </p>
<p class="calibre1">twice the number of parts [at Sindelfingen] . . . Mr. Rottke informs us that </p>
<p class="calibre1">only 60% of the parts are now being manufactured at Sindelfingen." John- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ston traveled to Berlin immediately, and reported back in minute detail on </p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed expansion plans, explaining on a veritable floor-by-floor basis </p>
<p class="calibre1">which improvements had been approved by Watson, and which were still </p>
<p class="calibre1">awaiting permission. Watson's consent was required for even the smallest </p>
<p class="calibre1">change in factory layout. For example, wrote Johnston, "if we should obtain </p>
<p class="calibre1">the authorization of Mr. Watson for the shaded part of the plan for the new </p>
<p class="calibre1">building, we could expect an increase of 3 x 462 sq. meters or a total of </p>
<p class="calibre1">1,386 sq. meters space . . . which increase would be sufficient for our needs </p>
<p class="calibre1">for some length of time."80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnston assured Holt, "The figure of 60 of the total output of parts </p>
<p class="calibre1">now being manufactured in Sindelfingen will be gready increased." He </p>
<p class="calibre1">stressed that many of the new machine tools were just being delivered and </p>
<p class="calibre1">would be brought on line soon.81 More machines would be built—faster, </p>
<p class="calibre1">better, cheaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe was hurtling toward all-out war. Dehomag would be ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CZECHOSLOVAKIA WAS NEXT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler,  in  1938,  demanded  the  largely  Germanic  Sudetenland  region  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia  be  handed  to  the  Reich.  Not  only  were  there  3  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">German-speaking  residents  in  the  Sudetenland,  but  Czechoslovakia  pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sessed the raw materials that Hitler coveted. German generals had already </p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn  up  invasion  plans.  But  hoping  to  avert  war,  Britain  and  France,  in  tan- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dem with Italy, negotiated with Hi t l er  for a compromise.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  dramatic  ups  and  downs,  the  last-minute  Munich  Pact  of  Septem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ber  30,  1938,  ceded  the  Sudetenland  to  Germany  as  of  the  next  day.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">deal  was  called  appeasement  and  was  foisted  upon  Czechoslovakia  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">European powers without regard for the Czech nation.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  1,  1938,  German  forces  moved  in  according  to  a  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged  takeover  schedule.  Within  hours  of  entering  any  town,  it  was  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">formed.  Streets  and  buildings  were  bedecked  with  Nazi  bunting  and  swastika </p>
<p class="calibre1">flags.  For  months,  highly  organized  Sudeten  Nazis  functioned  as  a  vanguard </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  oppression  to  come,  burning  Jewish  homes  and  boycotting  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">stores.  Now  they  ensured  that  Jewish  shops  were  smeared  with  white  paint.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one doubted what would come next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  October  2,  thousands  of  Jews  flooded  across  the  new  border  by  car, </p>
<p class="calibre1">train, and on foot into what remained of Czechoslovakia.85 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  remaining  behind  found  themselves  identified,  in  spite  of  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">highly  assimilated  Czech  national  character.  Nazi  contingents  would  system- </p>
<p class="calibre1">atically  appear  on  their  streets,  drag  families  from  their  homes,  herd  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  trucks,  and  either  deliver  them  to  concentration  camps  or  dump  them </p>
<p class="calibre1">penniless  on  the  border  with  remnant  Czechoslovakia.  Many  women  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">children,  already  beaten  and  bloody,  were  forced  to  cross  the  frontier  crawl- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  on  their  hands  and  knees,  some  on  their  bellies.  Soon,  their  overwhelm- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  numbers—as  many  as  40,000  had  either  fled  or  been  expelled—were </p>
<p class="calibre1">too  much  for  the  Czechs.  Nor  were  the  Czechs  willing  to  provoke  the  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mans  by  seeming  to  create  a  refuge  for  deported  Jews.  The  Czechs  refused </p>
<p class="calibre1">them entry.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ousted  from  the  Sudetenland,  and  barred  from  the  reduced  Czechoslo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vakia,  thousands  of  expelled  Jews  were  now  stranded  in  slender  tracts  of  no- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man's  land  between  border  crossings.  Dispossessed  of  everything,  hundreds </p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelled  in  roadside  ditches,  completely  exposed  to  the  elements  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">food,  water,  sanitation,  or  an  understanding  of  how  they  had  been  identified </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  why  they  were  suffering  this  fate.  South  of  Bruenn,  150  huddled  beneath </p>
<p class="calibre1">hedges.  Near  Kostitz:  52  people.  Outside  Reigern:  51  people.  Food  ship- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ments  sent  by  relief  committees  were  blocked  by  Czech  guards,  German  sol- </p>
<p class="calibre1">diers,  or  Party  stalwarts.  Then  came  rains  to  magnify  their  misery  and  muddy </p>
<p class="calibre1">their nightmare.87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  agony  of  these  ditch  people  became  an  on-going  spectacle  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world's  media.  They  survived  from  moment  to  moment  only  on  the  morsels </p>
<p class="calibre1">of food thrown in pity by passersby transiting the borders and disregarding </p>
<p class="calibre1">prohibitions  on  aid.  When  the  trapped  Jews  were  finally  forced  back  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German side, vicious mobs of jeering Nazis brutalized them.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Sudetenland was not enough for Hitler. In early 1939, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Reich pressured Czechoslovakia to commence its own anti-Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">ousters, including those Jews who had fled Germany, Austria, and the Sude- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tenland. Czechoslovakia complied, hoping to forestall an invasion. At 6 A.M. </p>
<p class="calibre1">on March 15, 1939, the Reich invaded anyway. German troops pushed into </p>
<p class="calibre1">all of Moravia and Bohemia. Hitler declared the whole of Czechoslovakia a </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich Protectorate under the iron-handed rule of appointed Governors. Now </p>
<p class="calibre1">all of Czech Jewry would be decimated. A staccato of anti-Semitic registra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions, expulsions, and confiscations soon descended upon all of what was </p>
<p class="calibre1">once known as Czechoslovakia.89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  days,  newspapers  were  reporting  the  same  sorrowful  fate  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czech  Jewry  as  experienced  elsewhere.  Doctors  and  merchants  were  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pelled    from  their  posts  and  professional  associations.    Synagogues  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">burned. Signs forbidding Jews at cafes and other stores appeared.90 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  suicides  began.  Thirty  per  day  in  Prague.  In  Chicago,  a  number  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czech  refugees  who  had  been  admitted  on  temporary  visas  formed  a  "sui- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cide  colony."  One  member  of  the  colony  was  Mrs.  Karel  Langer,  who  ended </p>
<p class="calibre1">her  family's  life  in  the  Congress  Hotel.  First  she  hurled  her  two  young  boys, </p>
<p class="calibre1">six  and four  years  of  age,  out  of  the  window  of  the thirteenth  floor.  She  leapt </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  them  just  seconds  later.  Police  recovered  all  three  bodies  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michigan Avenue sidewalk.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Registration  of  property  and  family  members  was  extended  not  only  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">those  who  outwardly  practiced  Judaism,  but  those  defined  by  the  Nurem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">berg  Laws  as  having  three  and  in  some  cases,  two,  Jewish  grandparents.  An </p>
<p class="calibre1">estimated 200,000 would be involved.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM was already in Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Hitler came to power, </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM NY had established a service bureau in Prague. The first school for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czech salesmen was opened in 1935 about the time the Nuremberg Laws </p>
<p class="calibre1">were passed. In November 1936, Watson approved a card printing plant in a </p>
<p class="calibre1">small town near Prague, where sixteen printers and two cutting machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">were installed. Some months later, as IBM ramped up operations, the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany protested when Czech Customs changed the company's tariff classifica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion from simplistic mechanical punches to statistical machines.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1937, Georg Schneider was hired as an additional salesman for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prague. Within about a year, Schneider was transferred to Dehomag in Berlin </p>
<p class="calibre1">"as a salesman and studying the German organization." He met Watson in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin, as well as the company's leading Swiss-based supervisors. By that </p>
<p class="calibre1">time,  Czechoslovakian  State  Railways  was  utilizing  52.2  million  punch  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">per  year.  In  1939,  IBM  Geneva  and  Dehomag  agreed  that  Schneider  should </p>
<p class="calibre1">return  to  Prague,  where  about  sixty  employees  worked,  as  the  new  co-man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ager  working  with  Director  Emil  Kuzcek.  At  about  that  time,  the  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened  the  Statistical  Office  for  the  Protectorate  of  Bohemia  and  Moravia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">located  in  Prague.  IBM  did  not  list  itself  in  Czech  commercial  registries  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">owning  its  own  subsidiary.  Instead,  the  subsidiary's  200,000  Korunas  value </p>
<p class="calibre1">was held 102,000 by  IBM's attorney in Prague, Stefan Schmid, and 98,000 by </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  European  General  Manager  John  Holt,  both  men  acting  as  nominees </p>
<p class="calibre1">for IBM NY.94 </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  IBM,  the  question  was  not  how  deeply  Dehomag  would  control  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollerith  activity  in  Czechoslovakia,  but  once  again,  who  would  share  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">profit.  In  the  first  days  of  1939,  after  Germany's  takeover  of  the  Sudetenland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  at  the  height  of  the  Reich's  threats  to  take  over  the  rest  of  Czechoslova- </p>
<p class="calibre1">kia,  IBM  worried  about  the  bonus  question  with  Heidinger,  Rottke,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  January  11,  1939,  Watson's  personal  emissary,  Harrison  Chauncey, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drafted  a  letter  for  European  Manager  Holt  in  Geneva,  reviewing  how  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">oral  arrangement  with  Dehomag  for  "new  territories"  might  work  once </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia  was  included.  So  there  was  no  mistake,  Chauncey  recited  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">language  from  the  oral  arrangement.  "'In  case  the  IBM  should  voluntarily </p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer  the  working  of  territories  outside  of  Germany  to  the  Dehomag,'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey  quoted,  "'we  also  agree  that,  upon  the  request  of  the  IBM,  we  can </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  totally  or  partly  excluded  from  the  results  of  the  business  transactions  ..  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  they  have  been  agreed  upon  in  the  form  of  a  bonus  in  the  loan </p>
<p class="calibre1">agreements.'"95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  Chauncey  posited  the  question:  "In  the  case  of  Austria  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia,  should  determination  be  made  whether  or  not  at  this  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  to  whether  Rottke  and  Hummel  should  receive  the  benefits  from  any  busi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ness within these two countries."96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  an  effort  to  create  deniability  about  the  decision,  Chauncey  added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"under  present  circumstances  it  might  be  unwise  for  the  IBM  to  make  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">determination."  Written  by  hand,  the  sentence  appended,  "but  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">should  when  time  is  proper."  Thus,  IBM  NY  could  claim  that  Czech  activity </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  undertaken  at  Dehomag's  sole  decision—even  though  no  such  activity </p>
<p class="calibre1">could take place without Watson's permission.97 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Addressing  the  time  constraints,  Chauncey  wrote,  "You  might  consider </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether  Dehomag  should  have  an  understanding  immediately,  because,  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">course, there will also be involved a transfer of the assets in Austria and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia."98 Chauncey's letter did not refer to "the Sudetenland," </p>
<p class="calibre1">which had already been swept into t h e  Reich, but "Czechoslovakia"; although </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia was being daily threatened with forcible annexation, Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many </p>
<p class="calibre1">was </p>
<p class="calibre1">still </p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks </p>
<p class="calibre1">away </p>
<p class="calibre1">from </p>
<p class="calibre1">its </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  senior  IBM  executive,  John  G.  Phillips,  scribbled  on  the  draft,  "have </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chauncey see me." On January 17, 1939, the heavily  edited letter to Holt was </p>
<p class="calibre1">formally  typed  on  letterhead  and  again  submitted  to  senior  executives  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">review. Still maintaining deniability, the revised version suggested, "Under </p>
<p class="calibre1">present circumstances, we wonder whether it would be unwise for IBM to </p>
<p class="calibre1">make  the  determination  relating  to  territory  and  products.  We  might  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sider whether it would be more proper to have Rottke and Hummel write </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag setting forth substantially the same thing as in the letter to Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gubelman.  .  ..  You  might  consider  whether  Dehomag  should  have  an  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing  immediately,  because,  of  course,  there  will  also  be  involved  a  trans- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fer of the assets in Austria and Czechoslovakia."99 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Chauncey's letter still seemed too sensitive for senior IBM execu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tives, Newspaper headlines and newsreels were blasting Germany daily for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Czech situation. After ten days, the letter was still not approved, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">finally on January 27, Chauncey was instructed by Phillips, "suggest we hold </p>
<p class="calibre1">on this for the present."100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  lost  no  time  in  proceeding  in  Czechoslovakia—with  or  with- </p>
<p class="calibre1">out  settling  the  question  of  bonuses  for  Czech  activity.  But  even  if  Rottke </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Hummel  were  willing  to  wait  for  a  decision  on  bonuses,  Heidinger  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">not.  As  Germany  prepared  to  launch  an  invasion  against  Czechoslovakia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  unleashed  his  own  battle  plan  to  secure  a  share  in  the  profit  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM organization expected in newly conquered territories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GERMANY  WAS  facing  economic  collapse  and  began  clamping  down  on  tax- </p>
<p class="calibre1">payers  and  profiteers.  Watson  had  refused  to  declare  a  profit  since  1934, </p>
<p class="calibre1">despite  record  multi-million  mark  earnings.  Tax  authorities  reviewed  RM </p>
<p class="calibre1">180,000  in  IBM  advances  and  loans  to  Heidinger  in  lieu  of  actual  profit  divi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dends.  Heidinger's  money  was  declared  a  bonus  no  matter  how  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">disguised—and  he  was  ordered  to  pay  RM  90,000  in  taxes.  On  January  20, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938,  Heidinger  wrote  to  IBM's  Holt  in  Geneva  complaining  that  no  matter </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  IBM  called it,  'The German  government  considers it  as  a  dividend  and  I </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  to  pay  the  [income]  taxes."  The  levy  was  in  addition  to  his  normal </p>
<p class="calibre1">income  taxes.  "That  is  impossible  for  me,"  he  conceded.  "I  would  have  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">burden my properties with a mortgage or to change my standard of life."101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  offered  IBM  an  ultimatum:  either  declare  a  bona  fide  profit </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  pay  a  d i vi d e n d   for  prior  years  that   would  net  him  RM  250,000—or  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  exercise  an  o p t i o n   requiring  IBM  to  buy  back  his  shares  in  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany.  For  now,  he  was  offering  just  one  of  his  ten  shares.  He  would  still  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tain  9  percent.  "Find  out  which  .  .  .  Mr.  Watson  would  prefer,"  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked.102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alarms  went  off  in  Geneva,  Paris,  and  New  York.  IBM  had  no  objection </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  a  stock  buy-back.  But  everyone  understood  that  if  Heidinger  reduced  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">holdings  below  10  percent  that  might  cause  Nazi  authorities  to  re-examine </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Aryan  nature  of  Dehomag.  The  company  could  lose  the  ability  to  use </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deutsche"  in  its  name,  and  might  even  be  taken  over  by  kommissars.103  More- </p>
<p class="calibre1">over,  in  Germany's  current  state  of  war  preparedness,  punch  card  technology </p>
<p class="calibre1">overseers in the Ministry of War could even decree a takeover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letters  flew  across  the  Atlantic  as  IBM  tried  to  plan  its  next  move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  Geneva  Controller  J.  C.  Milner  coolly  informed  Rottke  that  the  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany  had  no  difficulty  declaring  a  dividend,  but  German  law  limited  such </p>
<p class="calibre1">distributions  to  6  or  8  percent—and  that  amount  would  not  be  much  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  monies  already  advanced.  As  for  Heidinger  selling  back  his  stock,  Mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ner  curtly  wrote,  "we  can  take  no  decision  on  this."  Rottke  wrote  back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">encouraging  New  York  to  pay  Heidinger.  Stalling  for  time,  Milner  replied, "it </p>
<p class="calibre1">will not  be  possible to  come  to  a  final  decision ...  until  such  time  as  I  receive </p>
<p class="calibre1">a reply from Head Office."104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke's  reply  was  explicit:  "I  would  gather  .  .  .  the  IBM  does  not  wish </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  purchase  this  interest  [Heidinger's  stock]  ...  inasmuch  as  a  change  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  interests  into  foreign  hands  would  be  a  disadvantage  at  the  present </p>
<p class="calibre1">time.  However,  something  will  have  to  be  done,  because  Heidinger  needs </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  and  can  or  will  obtain  it  by  other  means;  nobody  will  be  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">legally prevent him from selling."105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">spring </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more </p>
<p class="calibre1">letters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">conferences, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">debates </p>
<p class="calibre1">streamed  between  IBM  offices  on  both  sides  of  the  ocean.  Watson  personally </p>
<p class="calibre1">called  for  written  recommendations  and  proposed  agreements  from  special </p>
<p class="calibre1">advisors,  accountants,  and  attorneys  both  in  and  out  of  Germany.  In  some </p>
<p class="calibre1">cases,  one  translation  wasn't  enough  for  Watson.  The  whole  dispute  was  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming  at  a  difficult  time  in  view  of  Dehomag's  expansion  plans.  Austria </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  just  been  annexed,  and  Germany  was  openly  planning  the  takeover  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia.  Even  as  Watson  was  battling  Heidinger's  demand  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">bonuses,  he  was  cautiously  negotiating  the  nature  and  bonuses  of  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">expansion into "new territories," such as Austria and Czechoslovakia.106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson compromised—in a way. With his consent, Dehomag adopted a </p>
<p class="calibre1">shareholder resolution for "an eventual dividend to be declared for the years </p>
<p class="calibre1">1935, 1936 and  1937." When it was, Heidinger would be paid his long </p>
<p class="calibre1">awaited bonus, less all his advances, of course. In the meantime, Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  outside  advisors  would  provide  the  written  opinions  about  how  much </p>
<p class="calibre1">profit  was  legally  permissible  to  declare  under  existing  German  law  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">incurring  confiscatory  taxes  and  mandatory  loans  to  the  Reich.  To  assuage  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">nervous  Heidinger,  Watson  agreed  to  provide  yet  more  advances,  RM  7,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">monthly for the remainder of 1938.107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Heidinger was impatient. While he had appealed the tax decision, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he did not expect to prevail. Soon, Heidinger would have to pay a huge </p>
<p class="calibre1">assessment. Dehomag's books reflected one multi-million mark record after </p>
<p class="calibre1">another—1938 alone would yield RM 2.39 million in conceded profits even </p>
<p class="calibre1">after IBM applied various intra-company devices.108 Yet Watson still delayed </p>
<p class="calibre1">any decision on declaring a profit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  in  late  November  1938,  just  days  after  Kristallnacht,  a  furious </p>
<p class="calibre1">exchange of correspondence between New York and Berlin escalated into a </p>
<p class="calibre1">stubborn </p>
<p class="calibre1">standoff </p>
<p class="calibre1">over </p>
<p class="calibre1">dividing </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  squabbling  culminated  with  Heidinger  implying  that  Watson  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">involved  in  defrauding  the  Reich  tax  authorities.  In  a  long,  rambling  and  sar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">castic  five-page  letter  to  one  of  Watson's  Berlin  attorneys,  Heidinger  openly </p>
<p class="calibre1">conceded  his  stock  was  a  sham.  Referring  to  his  so-called  "preferred  shares </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Dehomag,"  Heidinger  declared,  "My  company  shares  are  no  real  preferred </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares, if for instance the Tabulating Division would yield no net profit, while </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  remaining  divisions  would  earn  a  net  profit  of  say  five  percent,  on  my </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares,  I  would  not  obtain  anything  and  the  remaining  five  percent  are  there- </p>
<p class="calibre1">fore not preferred in that case but disadvantaged."109 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger's letter repeatedly insisted the bogus share arrangement </p>
<p class="calibre1">might be viewed by the authorities as a scheme "flatly to evade paragraph 3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the law." He invoked strong words, uncharacteristic of IBM's usual ambi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">guity. At one point, he referred to "a tax liability evaded by abnormal mea- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sures." The word "evade" was used repeatedly, as in "tax evasion." Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">even added an unsubtle hint of criminality, writing, "But by no means must </p>
<p class="calibre1">we expose the Dehomag to the risk of a penal prosecution." As was his style, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he flamboyandy concluded his pejorative missive "with renewed hearty </p>
<p class="calibre1">thanks."110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  sought  help  from  Price  Waterhouse.  But  the  prestigious  accoun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tancy  firm  could  only  conclude  Dehomag's  finances  were  in  supremely </p>
<p class="calibre1">profitable  condition  and  that  Heidinger  deserved  his  bonus.  In  its  lengthy </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirteen-page single-spaced analysis, dated December 30, 1938, Price Water- </p>
<p class="calibre1">house  declared:  the  only  question  is  when  and  how  much  to  pay  Heidinger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  warned    Price    Waterhouse,  if  Heidinger  insisted  on    selling  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">shares,  the  value  of  that  stock—real  or  not—was  far  greater  than  when  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">original  merger  took  place  in  1934.  Using  rigid  principles  of  valuation,  Price </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waterhouse  examined  the  pluses  and  minuses  of  the  German  political  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  environment,  and  the  problem  of  blocked  bank  accounts.  The  firm  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eluded  that  each  share  of  Dehomag  was  actually  "worth  more  to  a  purchaser </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Germany,  than  to  a  resident  abroad."  The  report  underlined  the  words  "in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany."111  For  Watson,  this  meant  that  his  shares  were  now  actually  less </p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable than Heidinger's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  Price  Waterhouse  asserted,  Dehomag  by  any  measure  had  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  more  valuable.  The  net  worth  of  the  company  had  essentially  dou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bled  from  its  RM  7.7  million  total  investment  in  1934  to  more  than  RM  14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million.  Annual  earnings  were  about  RM  2.3  million,  a  16  percent  return  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">net assets.112 </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  more  bad  news  came.  Dehomag  was  supplying </p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery  and  spare  parts  to  IBM  for  resale  throughout  Europe.  IBM  in  turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">merely  credited  Dehomag's  loan  balance  account.  Frustrated  and  defiant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  managers  in  mid-December  1938  unilaterally  began  terming  those </p>
<p class="calibre1">shipments  "exports."  This  triggered  the  Reich's  rule  requiring  actual  foreign </p>
<p class="calibre1">currency  payment,  which  Dehomag  obtained  by  debiting  IBM's  precious  few </p>
<p class="calibre1">dollar accounts in Germany.113 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  January  3,  1939,  IBM's  Geneva  Controller  J.  C.  Milner  mailed  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son  a  long,  detailed  letter  explicating  the  adverse  Price  Waterhouse  report, </p>
<p class="calibre1">searching  for  silver  linings,  parsing  Heidinger's  contract  language,  and  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately  trying  to  construct  loopholes  around  the  inevitability  of  either  paying </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger  dividends  or  buying  part  of  his  stock.  Milner  conceded  that  buy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  just  one  of  Heidinger's  shares  would  expose  the  subsidiary  as  American- </p>
<p class="calibre1">controlled.114 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Milner  explored  all  the  possibilities.  "If  he  [Heidinger]  died  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock  was  offered  to  IBM,  in  accordance  with  his  contract,  the  higher  book </p>
<p class="calibre1">value  combined  with  the  earnings  of  the  company  would  probably  force  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">high  valuation  of  the  stock,"  asserted  Milner.  Maybe  the  company  could  pay </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  elderly  Heidinger  in  ten  annual  installments?  Could  Dehomag  purchase </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger's  stock  with  blocked  marks  as  an  internal  obligation?  Milner </p>
<p class="calibre1">offered a range of options, none of them promising.115 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seemed  to  be  a  no-win  dilemma  for  IBM.  Purchase  of  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">stock was out of the question, asserted Milner, because no one could predict </p>
<p class="calibre1">what the Reich economic and taxing authorities would do. On the other </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,  once  dividends  on  the  1935—  1937  period  were  formally  paid  to  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger,  he  would  next  ask  for  dividends  for  1938.  It  would  continue  annu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ally even as the company's value escalated.116 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, money was a pressure tactic IBM could use. Heidinger was </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving a monthly allowance of RM 7,000 for all of 1938. Milner had some </p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks earlier reminded IBM attorneys in New York, "the last payment on </p>
<p class="calibre1">this account will fall due in December. It will then be necessary for a deci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion to be made regarding the year 1939."117 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger was being squeezed. Not only was he liable for a RM 90,000 </p>
<p class="calibre1">tax, but because of the protracted reporting delay, German tax authorities </p>
<p class="calibre1">had added a mandatory loan to the government, made retroactive for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">three wars 1934-1937, and that loan totaled RM 151,000. He could never </p>
<p class="calibre1">afford that without help from the company. Watson understood that, and cut </p>
<p class="calibre1">off Heidinger's RM 7,000 monthly advance.118 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  March  13  letter,  Rottke  implored  Milner  to  advance  Heidinger  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">money  needed  for  the  mandatory  loan.119  Heidinger  was  clearly  desperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tax  monies  would  be  due  within  a  matter  of  weeks.  He  had  accommodated </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson all these years. Now he needed help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson was unmoved. On March 15, the day the Nazis smashed into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the remainder of Czechoslovakia, Milner calmly answered Rottke, expressing </p>
<p class="calibre1">regret for a "very awkward condition." But in fact, insisted Milner, it was Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger who had insisted that dividends be paid. If now the taxing authority </p>
<p class="calibre1">had imposed mandatory loans, that was Heidinger's problem. Indeed, IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorneys in Berlin had carefully studied current regulations and determined </p>
<p class="calibre1">that IBM had actually advanced monies above the legal limit. 'Therefore," </p>
<p class="calibre1">asserted Milner, "it is Mr. Heidinger who has received too much money, and it </p>
<p class="calibre1">is he who should make arrangements to invest the surplus with the Loan </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stock Bank."120 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  describing  the  mess  to  the  IBM  NY  officers,  Milner  caustically  noted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  cannot  be  blamed  if  Mr.  Heidinger's  own  government  will  not  let  him </p>
<p class="calibre1">draw  adequate  cash  dividends.  On  the  other  hand,  this  increases  the  hazard </p>
<p class="calibre1">of his offering to sell us some of his stock."121 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, IBM was negotiating with the subsidiary's two other </p>
<p class="calibre1">managers, Hummel and Rottke, over the profit sharing plan for Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">activities outside of Germany. On March 21, six days after Czechoslovakia </p>
<p class="calibre1">had been seized, even as Poland, Lithuania, and other countries were being </p>
<p class="calibre1">actively threatened with German invasion, IBM European troubleshooter </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harrison  Chancey  dashed  a  short  note  off  to  Phillips  about  the  bonus  terms </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  "new  territories"  to  be  handed  to  Dehomag.  "I  wonder,"  Chauncey  asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"if  the  further  changes  in  the  German  political  situation  require  any  consider- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ation of this subject at this time?" Phillips in New York scrawled a note back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Considering  present  changes  in  the  map  of  Europe  don't  you  consider  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">best to wait?"122 </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  no  longer  just  Austria  and  Czechoslovakia.  Clearly,  other  nations </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  soon  come  under  Dehomag's  sphere  of  influence.  IBM  was  trying  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">plan ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BRINKSMANSHIP  WAS  Watson's  specialty.  First  he  instructed  Holt  not  to  go </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Berlin  to  participate  in  a  scheduled  shareholders  meeting.  Hence,  no  deci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sion  could  be  voted  on  Heidinger's  request.  As  each  day  passed,  Heidinger's </p>
<p class="calibre1">financial situation worsened.123 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  on  March  31,  1939,  Watson  cabled  Holt:  "Loan  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">150,000  marks  to  pay  Loan  Stock  Account  and  also  authorize  you  to  vote  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">payment  of  8%  dividend,  you  to  invest  our  dividend  money  in  real  estate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  German  law,  8  percent  was  the  legal  limit  IBM  could  pay  without </p>
<p class="calibre1">incurring  additional  taxation.  The  8  percent  dividend  was  to  be  paid </p>
<p class="calibre1">monthly  just  as  the  advance  was.  But  8  percent  would  total  RM  3,500,  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">half  of  what  Heidinger  needed  to  pay  his  bills  and  half  the  16  percent  return </p>
<p class="calibre1">identified  by  Price  Waterhouse.124  Heidinger  needed  RM  7,000  per  month. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was fed up with IBM and Watson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">APRIL 26, 1939 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas J. Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">President of the IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Mr. Watson! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  you  know,  up  to  the  end  of  last  year,  I  received  a  monthly </p>
<p class="calibre1">payment  of  RM  7000—as  an  advance  on  account  of  dividends.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">these  payments  have  been  stopped  since  Jan.  39  ...  since  that  date,  no </p>
<p class="calibre1">shareholders  meeting  took  place  and  therefore  a  corresponding  resolu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion could not be formed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  meeting  has  been  called  for  April  11...  Mr.  Holt  replied  ...  "it  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  convenient  for  him  to  come  Berlin"  and  that  he  acts  solely  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity of the chief stockholder, the IBM... </p>
<p class="calibre1">April  14,  Mr.  Rottke  wrote  to  Mr.  Milner...  saying  among  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">words:  "I  seriously  fear  that  Mr.  Heidinger  gets  in  economic  difficulties </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  therefore  I  beg  you  kindly  to  discuss  this  item  with  Mr.  Watson  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris  .  .  .  Today,  Mr.  Rottke  informed  me  that  he  received  a  letter  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Milner  ...  "to  advance  to  Mr.  Heidinger  on  account  of  dividends </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  1939,  a  sum  equal  to  eight  percent  of  his  capital  share  in  Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(That  means  RM  3,500).  This  may  be  advanced  monthly  ...  and  can </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  ratified  at  an  eventual  meeting  of  the  partners."  ...  That  means  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  IBM  either  does  not  like  my  partnership  or  at  least  that  it  does  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">attach great value to maintain my partnership in the Dehomag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unnecessary  to  say  how  sorry  and  how  deeply  depressed  I  feel </p>
<p class="calibre1">about  such  an  attitude,  which  in  all  probability  ends  my  partnership  ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  herewith  offer  my  shares  . . .   in  the  Dehomag  to  the  IBM  ...  negotiate </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  me  about  the  purchase  price  ...  accept  the  transfer  of  the  shares </p>
<p class="calibre1">to IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  would  be  very  happy  and  highly  appreciative  if  the  personal  rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  which  have  been  created  during  the  past  29  years  between  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  different  gentlemen  of  the  IBM  ...  and  between  you  and  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  not  be  changed  ...  Again  expressing  my  deepest  regret,  I  beg  to </p>

<p class="calibre1">very sincerely yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Willy Heidinger125 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke  openly  conceded  the  contract  between  IBM  and  Heidinger  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">"been  made  under  an  unlucky  star,  [and]  appears  to  be  the  source  of  all </p>
<p class="calibre1">evil."  But  he  nonetheless  warned  Watson  again  that  if  Heidinger's  shares </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  transferred  to  a  foreign  source  Dehomag  would  probably  not  be  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mitted  "the  use  of  the  word  Deutsche  (German)  as  an  enterprise  recognized </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Germany  as  German."126  That  disaster  had  to  be  avoided  at  all  costs.  To </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM's  doctrinaire  German  managers,  including  Heidinger,  Dehomag  repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sented  far  more  than  just  a  profit-making  enterprise.  To  them,  Dehomag  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  technologic  ability  to  keep  Germany's  war  machine  automated,  facilitate </p>
<p class="calibre1">her  highly  efficient  seizure  of  neighboring  countries,  and  achieve  the  Reich's </p>
<p class="calibre1">swiftly  moving  racial  agenda.  If  IBM's  subsidiary  were  deemed  non-Aryan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  company  would  be  barred  from  all  the  sensitive  projects  awaiting  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler's  Germany—in  spite  of  itself—would  be  deprived  of  the  Holleriths  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">so desperately required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  Watson's  point  of  view,  Germany  was  on  the  brink  of  unleash- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing its total conquest of Europe. IBM subsidiaries could be coordinated by </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag into one efficient continental enterprise, moving parts, cards, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  as  the  Reich  needed  them.   The  new  order  that  Hitler  promised  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">made to order for IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  July  1939,  Watson  arrived  in  Berlin  to  personally  mediate  with  Hei- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dinger.  A  compromise  would  be  necessary.  The  stakes  were  too  high  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis.  The  stakes  were  too  high  for  capitalism.  But  it  was  the  Germans  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">gave  in,  deferring  on  Heidinger's  demands  for  a  few  months  under  term </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  dictated.  "Watson  now  controlled  something  the  Third  Reich  needed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  launch  the  next  decisive  step  in  the  solution  of  the  Jewish  question,  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">just  in  Germany—but  all  of  Europe.  Until  now,  the  fastest  punchers,  tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors,  and  sorters  could  organize  only  by  numbers.  The  results  could  then  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorted  by  sequentially  numbered  profession,  geographic  locale,  or  popula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion category. But now Watson had something new and powerful.127 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had the alphabetizes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7 DEADLY  COUNT </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON   MAY  17,   1939,   GERMANY  WAS   SWEPT  BY  750,000   CENSUS </p>
<p class="calibre1">takers,  mainly  volunteers.  They  missed  virtually  no  one  in  the  Greater </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich's </p>
<p class="calibre1">22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million </p>
<p class="calibre1">households, </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million </p>
<p class="calibre1">farmhouses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.5  mi l li on  shops  and  factories.  Teams  of  five  to  eight  census  takers </p>
<p class="calibre1">fanned  out  through  the  big  cities  such  as  Berlin,  Frankfurt,  Ham- </p>
<p class="calibre1">burg,  and  Vienna.  Towns  and  villages  were  divided  into  districts  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty  homes  with  one  census  taker  assigned  to  each.  Some  80  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion  citizens  in  the  Greater  Reich,  including  Germany,  Austria,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sudentenland,  and  the  Saar,  would  be  classed  according  to  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestry.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was little question to the world that the May 1939 na- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional census was racial in nature. New York Times coverage of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">mammoth project made clear that this census would "provide de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tailed information on the ancestry, religious faith and material pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sessions of all residents. Special blanks will be provided on which </p>
<p class="calibre1">each person must state whether he is of pure 'Aryan' blood. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">status of each of his grandparents must be given and substantiated </p>
<p class="calibre1">by evidence in case of inquiry."2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, by May 1939, virtually every "practicing Jew" had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been registered, surveyed, numbered, and sorted numerous times </p>
<p class="calibre1">in a series of overlapping, often disjointed, campaigns. The purpose </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the 1939 census was to identify the so-called "racial Jews" in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany proper, add Jews of any definition in the new territories of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">expanded  Reich,  and  locate  each  individual  before  being  ghettoized  or  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">jected  to  other  action.  Indeed  the  ghettoization  decrees  had  begun  that  very </p>
<p class="calibre1">month.  In  addition,  Germany  was  preparing  for  all-out  war  and  without  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">census,  it  could  not  identify  exactly  where  all  its  draftable  men  were, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  women  would  step  into  their  economic  shoes  once  mobilized.3  As </p>
<p class="calibre1">such,  the  census  was  vital  to  Hitler's  two-front  war—one  against  the  Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and one against all of Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understandably,  Dehomag's  1939  undertaking  dwarfed  anything  it  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted  before,  including  the  1933  Prussian  census.  Months  of  intensive </p>
<p class="calibre1">training,  conducted  in  thousands  of  sessions,  prepared  legions  of  volunteers </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  critical  mission.  Police  and  their  auxiliaries  were  mandated  to  support </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  count  "with  all  their  powers"  and  "to  function  as  census-takers  in  difficult </p>
<p class="calibre1">and confusing residential areas," according to official regulations.4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  additional  Hollerith  machinery  assembled  was  massive:  400  elec- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trical  key  punches,  10  gang  punches,  20  summary  punches,  300  key  punch </p>
<p class="calibre1">verifiers,  70  sorters,  50  tabulators,  25  duplicators,  and  50  D-11  VZ  tabula- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tors.  The  Reich  had  imposed  seemingly  impossible  target  delivery  dates  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  1939.  So  to  increase  speed,  Dehomag's  engineers  converted  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">versatile  D-11  calculating  tabulator  into  a  pure  counting  machine  dubbed </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  D-11  VZ.  The  improvised  device  could  process  12,000  60-column </p>
<p class="calibre1">punched  cards  per  hour  in  sixteen  counters  and  then  precision-punch  its  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">summaries onto 80-column cards. Eighty million cards were actually used.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  special  envelope  containing  a  so-called  Supplemental  Card  was  cre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated.  This  all-important  card  recorded  the  individual's  bloodline  data  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">functioned  as  the  racial  linchpin  of  the  operation.  Each  head  of  household </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  to  fill  out  his  name  and  address  and  then  document  his  family's  ancestral </p>
<p class="calibre1">lines.  Jews  understandably  feared  the  newest  identification.  Census  takers </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  cautioned  to  overcome  any  distrust  by  assuring  families  that  the  infor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mation would not be released to the financial authorities.6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  it  was  not  German  taxing  agencies  that  were  the  most  eager  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">new  data.  It  was  the  Nazi Party  structure  and  Reich security  forces  seeking  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">locate  additional  Jews  and  other  undesirables.  Indeed,  the  final  data  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">intended  to  help  comprise  a  single  national  register  for  the  entire  Greater </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich.  Each  card  carried  a  single  column  coded  for  descent,  designed  into </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  card  prototype  long  before  the  census  was  launched.  A  letter  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Order  Police  to  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior  at  the  end  of  1938  explained: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This column on the registration card is included to be filled out at the right </p>
<p class="calibre1">time. That time should come in May of next year during the population, </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation, and company census. The regular questionnaire will be supple- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mented by an additional card. This card will include the question of whether </p>
<p class="calibre1">the person had any fully Jewish grandparent. Survey results will then be </p>
<p class="calibre1">evaluated using this registration card."7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 25 million Supplemental Cards—one for each household—repre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sented a virtual doubling of census files. To cope with the volume and still </p>
<p class="calibre1">meet deadlines, the census tabulation was divided into two operations. First, </p>
<p class="calibre1">each special envelope containing a Supplemental Card was labeled to corre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">spond to the household's general questionnaire, along with the district and </p>
<p class="calibre1">municipality  of  origin.  Then  local  officials,  generally  the  police,  affixed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">letter  "J"  to  both  the  questionnaires  and  cards  of  all  Jewish  families.8 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  words  "Do  Not  Send  Directly  to  the  [Berlin]  Statistical  Bureau" </p>
<p class="calibre1">were printed on every envelope. Instead, both the general questionnaire and </p>
<p class="calibre1">its  companion  special  envelope  were  sent  to  the  regional  statistical  offices  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  tedious  quality  control  procedures.  Did  the  envelopes  match  up  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">questionnaires? Were Supplemental Cards containing racial data and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">general  questionnaires  filled  out  completely?  Just  preparing  the  25  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">census  forms  and  25  million  Supplemental  Cards  for  processing  required  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">behemoth  manual  operation.  Once  approved,  the  questionnaires  and  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  transported  to  Berlin  and  separated.  The  Supplemental  Cards  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorted  into  three  groups:  non-Aryans,  "higher  educated  people,"  and  all  oth- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers. These were then tabulated to yield the racial data.9 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never before had so many been counted so thoroughly and quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reich Statistical Office hired an additional 2,000 staffers to process the </p>
<p class="calibre1">forms and race cards, which were enough to fill more than seventy boxcars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in 1933, Dehomag created cavernous counting rooms and management </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices  at  the  Statistical  Office  headquarters  in  Berlin  to  tabulate  the  informa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion.  Initially,  Dehomag's  army  of  operators  punched  450,000  cards  per  day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  time,  the  volume  reached  one  million  daily.  The  company  met  its  dead- </p>
<p class="calibre1">line.  Preliminary  analyzed  results  were  ready  by  November  10,  1939,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">one-year  anniversary  of  Kristallnacht,  and,  more  importandy  for  Hitler,  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">anniversary of Germany's surrender in the Great War.10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intense  demand  to  access  the  final  information  on  racial  Jews  came </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  competing  Nazi  organizations  as  well  as  state  and  national  government </p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaus.  But  anxious  local  and  state  agencies  would  have  to  wait.  For  exam- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ple,  municipal  officials  throughout  Saxony  asked  their  regional  statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices if they could examine the census data first to speed their ghettoization </p>
<p class="calibre1">and confiscation campaings. But the Reich Statistical Office in Berlin said no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greater  priority  was  granted  to  the  SD  and  Adolf  Eichmann's  Referat  II  112, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which both received copies of all  census registration lists.11 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  census  yielded  exactly  the  data  Nazi  Germany  needed,  including </p>
<p class="calibre1">data  for  the  areas  beyond  Germany.  Within  months,  for  example,  bureaucrats </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  Austrian  Statistical  Office  had  compiled  a  complete  profile  of  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">existence  in  the  country.  A  report  dispatched  to  Reich  officials  opened  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  explanation:  "In  the  census  of May  17,  1939,  the  question  was  put  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">first  time  whether  one  of  the  individual's  grandparents  was  a  full  Jew  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">race."  With  stunning  specificity,  the  extensive  summary  concluded,  "Accord- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  to  the  initial  results  of  this  year's  census,  there  were  91,480  full  Jews  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">22,344  part  Jews  of  Grades  I  and  II  in  Vienna  as  of  May  17,  1939.  In  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining  Reich  Districts  of  the  Ostmark  there  were  3,073  full  Jews  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">4,241  part Jews." Tables  displayed  the Jewish totals divided  into  full Jews,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  Grade  I  and  Grade  II  Jews.  Each  of  those  designations  was  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">divided  between  male  and  female  and  then  delineated  district  by  district  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">all  of  Vienna.  In  Innere  Stadt:  116  Grade  II  female  Jews.  In  Aimmering:  27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grade  II  males.  In  Wieden:  31  Grade  I  males.  Precise  numbers  were  tallied </p>
<p class="calibre1">for key regions as well: Salzburg, Tirol, and others.12 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag's  final  calculations  yielded  a  grand  total  of  330,539  so-called </p>
<p class="calibre1">"racial  Jews"  still  dwelling  within  the  expanded  Reich—Germany,  Austria </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Sudetenland.  This  was  far  less  than  the  wild  projections  of  1.5  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion  generated  four  years  earlier  when  the  Nuremberg  Laws  were  drafted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  count  showed  138,819  males  and  191,720  females—more  females </p>
<p class="calibre1">because  about  35,000  Jewish  wives  had  become  widowed  or  detached  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugee  men.  Clearly,  through  persecution,  emigration,  death  during  incar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ceration,  and  outright  execution,  Greater  Germany  had  lost  about  half  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">originally  counted  Jewish  population  of  some  502,000,  including  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">added  when  the  Saar  region  was  annexed  in  1935.  But,  by  adding  Austria </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  Sudetenland,  the  Third  Reich  discovered  that  by  1939  it  had  actually </p>
<p class="calibre1">gained an additional 96,893 Jews.13 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  there  were  hundreds  of  thousands  more  Jews  in  the  old </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia,  now  called  the  Protectorate  of  Bohemia  and  Moravia.  Mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lions  more  existed  in  Poland  and  other  countries  in  Europe  that  Germany </p>
<p class="calibre1">planned  to  conquer  or  dominate.  Indeed,  the  same  German  refugees  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be encountered again and again as they fled from nation to nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emigration  and  deportation  would  not  work.  Jewish  refugees  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">being,  or  would  be,  reabsorbed  as  Germany  annexed  or  invaded  new  territo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ries in Europe. Dehomag's numbers told them exactly how many Jews could </p>
<p class="calibre1">be found in the Greater Reich, and soon I B M  subsidiaries throughout Europe </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  help  compile  the  numbers  for  invaded  territories  as  well.  It  seemed </p>
<p class="calibre1">the more the Reich achieved its territorial goals, the more Jews it encountered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A better solution would be needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BY  1939,  Nazi  race  policy  had  evolved.  No  longer  was  Germany's  anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semitic crusade content with just ridding the Greater Reich of Jews. Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  always  wanted  all  Europe  completely  Jew-free.  In  pursuit  of  that  goal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">NSDAP forces had spent years subversively cultivating paramilitary Fascist </p>
<p class="calibre1">surrogates worldwide—from Brazil's Integralite Party to Syria's Phalange </p>
<p class="calibre1">militia. Europe, of course, was the Nazi success story. Romania's Iron Guard </p>
<p class="calibre1">was highly organized and impatient. In Holland, it was the Dutch Nazi Party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish Brown Shirts terrorized Jews. In Hungary, the Arrow Cross Party agi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tated. In Croatia, blood-lusting Ustashi could not wait. Whether their shirts </p>
<p class="calibre1">were black, brown, or silver, whether of German extraction or merely anti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semites in other lands, these people could be relied upon to preach Hitler's </p>
<p class="calibre1">ideology of Jew-hatred, racial castes, and Aryan superiority.14 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever those of German ancestry or ultra-nationalists existed, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reich sought to use them as advance troops organized around strict Aryan </p>
<p class="calibre1">principles. The Auslandsorganisation of the NSDAP, an association of German </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis living abroad, was the backbone of this movement. Berlin expected </p>
<p class="calibre1">members to help achieve its goals. Typical was a published exhortation in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German press demanding all Aryans to observe rigid racial purity. In that </p>
<p class="calibre1">same vein, Goering had demanded quite publicly in his speeches that Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mans living in other countries terminate all Jewish employees and "be the </p>
<p class="calibre1">servants of this Homeland."15 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  keeping  track  of  potential  German  sympathizers  globally  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">prodigious  task.  As  early  as  summer  1938,  the  German  Foreign  Institute </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  Stuttgart  began  compiling  what  it  called  a  "German  world  migration  regis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter"  to  help  identify  its  friends  in  other  countries.  Advocates  insisted  "[t]he </p>
<p class="calibre1">World  Migration  Book  must  represent  more  than  a  card  index  but  a  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  world  .  .  .  [where]  eternal  Germanism  may  live."  The  Stuttgart  Kurier </p>
<p class="calibre1">asserted  that  the  Migration  Book  would  remind  Germans  worldwide  of  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">"never ending task to work with word and deed for the maintenance of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">German race."16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  as  it  rallied  Nazi  cohorts  throughout  Europe,  Berlin  pressured  its </p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbors  to  adopt  anti-Semitic  policies  along  Aryan  lines  to  forestall  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man aggression. For example, just days before the Reich invaded Czechoslo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vakia,  Berlin  offered  to  respect  Prague's  borders  only  if  it  submitted  to  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">three-prong  ultimatum:  delivery  of  one  third  of  its  gold  reserves,  dismantling </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  its  army,  and  an  immediate  solution  of  the  Jewish  problem"  according  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuremberg racial definitions.17 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Country  after  country  adopted  laws  identical  to  German  race  policies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ousting  Jews,  confiscating  their  assets,  and  organizing  their  expulsion  long </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  the  Reich  crossed  their  borders.  By  spring  1939,  Hungary  had  already </p>
<p class="calibre1">passed  a  series  of  anti-Jewish  measures,  including  land  expropriation,  profes- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sional  exclusion,  and  citizenship  annulment.  A  New  York  Times  headline  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the question declared, "Aim to Head Off Nazis." Waves of pogroms and Nazi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">style  anti-Jewish  boycotts  and  economic  expulsions  had  long  been  sweeping </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland,  especially  in  areas  with  many  so-called  Volksdeutsche,  those  of  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man parentage. By 1937, a leading party in the Polish government, "the Camp </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  National  Unity,"  declared  the  popular  campaign  had  become  official,  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  delight  of  German-allied  Polish  Fascists.  Similar  persecution  was  regu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">larly  debated  in  Romania,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Lithuania.  Eventually  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">majority  of  Europe  would  soon  legislate  Jews  out  of  existence.  It  was  all  part </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Berlin's new continent-wide irresistible sphere of anti-Semitic influence.18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Berlin  was  igniting  anti-Jewish  campaigns  everywhere,  NSDAP </p>
<p class="calibre1">forces  were  quietly  gathering  population  details  on  Jews  throughout  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continent  and  preparing  for  the  day  when  Nazi-inspired  coups  or  outright </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion  would  permit  the  instant  liquidation  of  one  Jewish  community  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">another.  Nazi  race  and  population  scientists  utilizing  punch  card  systems </p>
<p class="calibre1">were a crucial component of this effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Typical  was  a  Nazi  operative  named  Carl  Fust,  who  was  scouting  church </p>
<p class="calibre1">records for familial information in Lithuania as far back as 1936. On June 29, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1936,  he  reported  his  progress  to  the  Reichssippenamt  in  Berlin.  "I  have  now </p>
<p class="calibre1">also  registered  all  known  books  of  the  Tilsit  Mennonite  Community,"  wrote </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fust.  "It  was  quite  a  task  to  find  the  present  location  of  the  books  .  .  .  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">entries  ...  go  partly  back  to  the  year  1769;  however,  individual  data  goes </p>
<p class="calibre1">back  as  far  as  1722."19  The  Reichssippenamt  automated  its  files  with  Hollerith </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  July  2,  1936,  several  Nazis  met  in  a  Breslau  inn  to  discuss  the  serv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ices  of  Fritz  Arlt,  a  Leipzig  statistician.  Arlt  had  created  a  cross-referenced </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  file  on  every  Leipzig  Jewish  resident,  down  to  so-called  quarter-Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  made  Arlt's  expertise  desirable  was  that  his  cards  also  listed  exactly </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  ancestral  Polish  towns  their  families  originated  from.  At  the  Breslau </p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting,  Arlt  was  assigned  to  work  with  the  security  offices  of  the  Ansland- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorganisation. His groundbreaking Polish demography was deemed so piv- </p>
<p class="calibre1">otal,  Arlt  was  asked  to  journey  to  Berlin  to  assist  Eichmann's  Referat  II </p>
<p class="calibre1">112, with travel expenses to be paid by t h e  SD.20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reich did everything in its power to extend its census, registration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and genealogical reach throughout Europe. Once it invaded or forced its </p>
<p class="calibre1">political domination in a neighboring country, it could then immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">locate both racial and practicing Jews. Berlin proved it could be done in Aus- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tria and the Sudetenland. But such demographic feats Europe-wide would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be impossible without detailed, automated information about Jewish citizens </p>
<p class="calibre1">in other lands. That required more than the resources of the Reich Statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office, it required multi-national statistical cooperation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  subsidiaries  throughout  Europe  had  long  been  working  in  unison </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  take  advantage  of  political  and  military  events  in  Europe.  Salesmen  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">stantly  shutded  from  various  countries  to  either  New  York  or  Berlin  for  train- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing,  and  were  then  transferred  back  to  their  original  countries  to  oversee </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  card  operations.  In  late  1939,  with  Thomas  Watson's  consent,  an  inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  training  school  for  IBM  service  engineers  throughout  Europe  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened  in  Berlin.  IBM  lectures  and  demonstrations  for  military  leaders  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">government  leaders  were  frequent—all  under  the  watchful  eye  of  IBM's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva office.21 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  first  three  months  of  1939  alone,  IBM  Sweden  sold  1.9  million </p>
<p class="calibre1">punch  cards  to  Denmark,  1.3  million  to  Finland,  and  696,000  to  Norway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  NY  sold  1  million  cards  to  Yugoslavia,  and  700,000  to  Spain.  Dehomag </p>
<p class="calibre1">sold 261,000 to Hungary.22 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On February 16, 1939, Reich legal authorities announced that the term </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aryan would be replaced in many instances by a new term: European racial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the new guidelines, other ethnic groups and races, such as Germany's </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanian and Hungarian allies, could be allowed to exist.23 But a Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">presence would be allowed nowhere on the Continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  late  spring  1939,  Europe  was  wracked  by  incremental  Nazi  land </p>
<p class="calibre1">grabs and invasions in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Memel region of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lithuania.  Massive  German  military  buildups,  including  troop  concentrations </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  its  extended  frontiers,  threatened  Denmark,  Poland,  Hungary,  Luxem- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bourg, Belgium, Holland, France, and England. European Jewry, including </p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was </p>
<p class="calibre1">threatened </p>
<p class="calibre1">with </p>
<p class="calibre1">extinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless,  Watson  went  full  speed  ahead  with  plans  for  the  1939 </p>
<p class="calibre1">International  Chamber  of  Commerce  Congress.  Originally  scheduled  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tokyo, Watson had relocated the conference to Copenhagen after a troubled </p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan  withdrew.  In  Copenhagen,  Watson  planned  to  make  his  most  stren- </p>
<p class="calibre1">uous appeal yet for raw materials to be handed over to Germany. As usual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  sought  polit ical  cover  for  his  act i vit ies.  He  wrote  to  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 9, 1939, for the usual open letter of support. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">time, Watson was more careful. "We should like very much to have a message </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  you  to  be  read  at  our  opening  session  on  June  26  .  .  .  [as]  in  our  last </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress in Berlin in 1937, and if it's still consistent with your policy."24 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  world  had  changed  dramatically  since  1937.  Germany  was  a  promi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nent  participant  of  the  Watson-dominated  ICC  Congress.  Diplomatic  rela- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  with  the  Reich  had  been  sorely  strained  since  Kristallnacht  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">various  invasions.  War  was  around  the  corner.  Washington  did  not  want  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">act  as  though  it  was  business  as  usual  for  Nazi  Germany  in  international  par- </p>
<p class="calibre1">leys.  Unsure  White  House  staffers  shunted  the  letter  to  Secretary  of  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cordell  Hull,  asking  him  to  prepare  Roosevelt's  comment  "if  you  approve  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sending of such a message."25 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Copenhagen,  at  the  ICC  Congress,  Watson's  pro-Axis  proposal </p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeded  anything  the  State  Department  could  have  expected.  He  champi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">oned  a  resolution  whereby  private  businessmen  from  the  three  Axis  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">three  Allied  nations  would  actually  supercede  their  governments  and  negoti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ate  a  radical  new  international  trade  policy  designed  to  satisfy  Axis  demands </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  raw  materials  coveted  from  other  nations.  The  businessmen  would  then </p>
<p class="calibre1">lobby  their  respective  governments'  official  economic  advisors  to  adopt  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeasement  proposals  for  the  sake  of  averting  war.  Ironically,  the  raw  mate- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rials were needed by Axis powers solely for the sake of waging war.26 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  June  28,  under  Watson's  leadership,  the  ICC  passed  a  resolution </p>
<p class="calibre1">again  calling  for  "a  fair  distribution  of  raw  materials,  food  stuffs  and  other </p>
<p class="calibre1">products  .  .  .  [to]  render  unnecessary  the  movements  of  armies  across  fron- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tiers." To this end, the ICC asked "the governments of France, Germany, Italy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  .  .  .  each  collaborate  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">their  own  leading  businessmen  .  ,  .  with  respect  to  national  needs  .  .  .  [and </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore]  give  all  countries  of  the  world  a  fair  opportunity  to  share  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">resources of the world."27 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  as  Watson  angled  for  Germany  to  be  ceded  more  raw  materials, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  was  openly  raping  invaded  territories.  Just  days  before,  on  June  2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  New  York  Times  carried  a  prominent  story  headlined  "Terrors  of  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">Related  by  Benes,"  based  on  an  international  radio  broadcast  pleading  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">anti-Nazi  resistance.  In  the  article,  purged  Czechoslovakian  President  Eduard </p>
<p class="calibre1">Benes  detailed  the  Reich's  methodical  theft  of  Czech  resources  since  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">March  15,  1939,  invasion. "Dr.  Benes  told  of  a  nation  of  10  million  persons," </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  New  York  Times  related,  "until  a  few  months  ago  proud  and  free,  being </p>
<p class="calibre1">systematically enslaved, degraded and robbed of its material and cultural </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">possessions.    The  article  indicated  that  Germany  "has  robbed  and  transported </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Germany  more  than  35  billion  crowns  ...  [$1.22  billion]  of  Czecho-Slovak </p>
<p class="calibre1">property."28 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Benes declared, "You all must have heard how the German dictatorship </p>
<p class="calibre1">is devastating the beauty that was Czecho-Slovakia, how splendid forests are </p>
<p class="calibre1">being destroyed and the lumber carted away to Germany, how public build- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ings... are being divested of their window frames, of their glass windows, of </p>
<p class="calibre1">all materials ... all supplies have been taken and transported to Germany.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Factories are being ruined and industry crippled as machinery is carried </p>
<p class="calibre1">away for war purposes."29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  added,  "Czech  families  spend  nights  in  the  woods,  not  daring  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep  in  their  own  beds  for  fear  of  Nazi  pogroms.  And  German  peasants, </p>
<p class="calibre1">excited  by  the  Nazis  who  have  come  from  Germany  for  that  purpose,  bran- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dish scythes and cry, 'The bloody night is coming.'"30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">No wonder the German delegate to the ICC enthusiastically lauded </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's proposal, which only sought to legitimize by private consultation </p>
<p class="calibre1">what the Third Reich was undertaking by force. In his final speech of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress, Watson himself summed up the misery and devastation in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world as a mere "difference of opinion." His solution of businessmen confer- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ring to divvy up other nations' resources to avoid further aggression was </p>
<p class="calibre1">offered with these words: "We regret that there are unsatisfactory economic </p>
<p class="calibre1">and political conditions in the world today, with a great difference of opinion </p>
<p class="calibre1">existing among many countries. But differences of opinion, freely discussed </p>
<p class="calibre1">and fairly disposed of, result in mutual benefit and increased happiness to all </p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned."31 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  so  enthusiastic  was  Watson  that  he  quickly  wrote  to  President </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roosevelt,  attaching  transcripts  from  the  conference  and  explaining  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">concept  of  a  private  survey  by  businessmen  to  resolve  and  rewrite  trade  bar- </p>
<p class="calibre1">riers  was  his  invention.  "You  will  note  that  this  resolution  does  not  suggest  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">political  conference,"  Watson  pointed  out  to  the  President,  stressing  the  non- </p>
<p class="calibre1">governmental  procedure.  But,  he  added,  once  the  private  recommendations </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  tendered,  the  six  nations  might  then  call  for  an  international  meeting  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">ratify  the  suggestions.  Watson  concluded  his  letter  indicating  that  he  had  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">"great  deal  of  background"  on  the  topic  "which  I  prefer  to  present  to  you  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">person."  He  added  a  tantalizing  triviality:  "I  also  have  a  very  interesting  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sonal  message  to  deliver  to  you  from  [the  Danish  monarch]  His  Majesty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">King Christian X."32 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  embarrassing  correspondence  asking  to  brief  Roosevelt  began </p>
<p class="calibre1">bouncing around the State Department, Division of European Affairs, Advi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor on Political Relations, Division of Trade Agreements, Department of Pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tocol,  Division  of  International  Conferences,  Office  of  the  Advisor  on  Inter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">national  Economic  Affairs,  and  Cordell  Hull  personally.  One  protocol  chief </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote,  "it  is  not  a  matter  for  us  .  ..  Mr.  Watson  being  an  American,  we  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">have  nothing  to  do  with  making  an  appointment  for  him  to  see  the  Presi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dent."  Another  offered  a  hairsplitting  technicality:  Watson  was  the  outgoing </p>
<p class="calibre1">president  of  the  ICC.  His  July  5  letter  to  Roosevelt  was  written  a  few  days </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  being  succeeded  at  the  ICC.  Therefore,  "It  does  not  appear  that  it  is </p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary  to  comment.  .  .  inasmuch  as  Mr.  Watson  is  no  longer  President  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  International  Chamber  and  the  resolution  does  not  come  to  us  officially </p>
<p class="calibre1">from that body."33 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,  an  innocuous  three-sentence  say-nothing  reply  was  cobbled </p>
<p class="calibre1">together  for  the  President's  review  after  being  initialed  by  no  fewer  than  ten </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department officials. It read: "My Dear Mr. Watson: I have received and read </p>
<p class="calibre1">with interest  your letter of July  5,  1939,  in  regard to  the  meeting  of  the Tenth </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congress  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce.  I  note  that  you  desire </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  discuss  some  of  the  background  of  this  meeting  with  me  in  person  and  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver  to  me  a  personal  message  from  His  Majesty  King  Christian  X.  I  shall </p>
<p class="calibre1">look forward to seeing you after you return to this country."34 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  explaining  so  unresponsive  a  reply  to  Watson's  elaborate  letter,  a  key </p>
<p class="calibre1">State  Department  official,  John  Hickerson,  caustically  wrote,  "It  seems  to  me </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  attached  draft  letter  for  the  President  to  Mr.  Watson  says  about  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  as  the  President  could  appropriately  say.  I  do  not  see  how  the  Presi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dent  could  well  comment  on  the  resolution  discussed  in  this  letter  recom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mending  that  the  Governments  of  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kingdom  and  the  United  States  appoint  economic  representatives  of  their  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">spective  governments  to  work  with  businessmen  in  regard  to  'their  own </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs and what they are able to contribute to the needs of other countries.'"35 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  sent  Hull  a  letter  almost  identical  to  the  one  he  sent  to  Roose- </p>
<p class="calibre1">velt.  The  same  State  Department  group  that  formulated  Roosevelt's  response </p>
<p class="calibre1">proffered  a  similar  reply  for  the  Secretary  of  State,  amounting  to  little  more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than  a  simple  and  non-committal  thanks  to  Watson  for  "your  letter  regarding </p>
<p class="calibre1">the activities of the Congress."36 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Watson  would  not  desist.  He  sent  formal  lithographed  resolutions </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  State  Department  hoping  to  rally  its  support  for  an  international  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ference  of  business  executives  to  parcel  out  the  world's  resources.  One  State </p>
<p class="calibre1">Department  assistant  secretary  could  not  help  but  comment  on  the  similarity </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Watson's suggestion to the Axis' own warlike demands. "This is, of course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a political question of major world importance," wrote the assistant secretary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  one  upon  which  we  have  been  hearing  much  from  Germany,  Italy  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan.  It  occurs  to  me  that  it  is  most  unfortunate  that  Mr.  Thomas  J.  Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  an  American  serving  as  the  president  of  the  International  Chamber  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commerce,  should  have  sponsored  a  resolution  of  this  character.  It  may  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  that  his  resolution  will  return  to  plague  us  at  some  future  date."  That </p>
<p class="calibre1">comment was written on October 5, 1939.37 By then it was unnecessary to reply </p>
<p class="calibre1">further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland had already been invaded. World War II had begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOURS  BEFORE  dawn  on  September  1,  1939,  SS  Officer  Alfred  Naujocks </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  preparing  to  launch  World  War  II.  For  days,  Naujocks'  detachment  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  soldiers  had  been  waiting.  Sometime  before  5:40  A.M.,  he  received </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  code  word  from  Berlin.  Working  methodically  and  according  to  plan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naujocks'  men  donned  Polish  uniforms  and  staged  a  fake  attack  against  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  radio  station.  Drugged  concentration  camp  inmates  were  dragged </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  position  and  smeared  with  blood  to  become  the  "German  casualties." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  sham  provided  Hitler  with  the  pretext  to  launch  Operation  Case  White </p>
<p class="calibre1">- the invasion of Poland.38 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany's assault was the fiercest and fastest in history. Hundreds of </p>
<p class="calibre1">airplanes mounted a sustained bombardment of Poland's railroads, storage </p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities, troop encampments, and cities. Six divisions of coordinated troops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tanks, and artillery ravished Warsaw. Within days, the New York Times and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other newspapers reported that three-fourths of much of the firebombed </p>
<p class="calibre1">and shell-battered capital was reduced to smoking rubble. So unique was </p>
<p class="calibre1">this attack, it was dubbed Blitzkrieg, or lightning war. Britain and France </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared war just days later.39 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland, essentially unarmored and in many cases deploying horse cav- </p>
<p class="calibre1">alry, held out for twenty-seven fierce days before its complete capitulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">News of barbarous massacres, rapes, inflicted starvation, systematic deporta- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions, and the resulting unchecked epidemics made headlines around the </p>
<p class="calibre1">world. In one incident in Nasielek, some 1,600 Jews were whipped all night in </p>
<p class="calibre1">what was termed a "whipping orgy." Two Jewish sisters were dragged from </p>
<p class="calibre1">their beds in the night and taken to a cemetery; one was raped and the other </p>
<p class="calibre1">given five zlotys and told to wait until next time. Shortly after the war began, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a New York Times article headlined "250,000 Jews listed As Dead in Poland."40 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish Jewry numbered more than 3 million persons—10 percent of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish population. Atrocities, rapes, and massacres could not wipe them all </p>
<p class="calibre1">away. Deportation to labor camps was underway. But something more drastic </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  needed.  A  German  military  review  of  specific  actions in  Poland  declared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  is  a  mistake  to  massacre  some  10,000  Jews  and  Poles,  as  is  being  done  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">present . . . this will not eradicate t he  idea of a Polish state, nor will the Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">be exterminated."41 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  September  13,  the  New  York  Times  reported  the  Reich's  dilemma </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  headline  declaring,  "Nazis  Hint  Purge  of  Jews  in  Poland,"  with  a  sub- </p>
<p class="calibre1">head,  "3,000,000  Population  Involved."  The  article  quoted  the  German  gov- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment  as  declaring  it  wanted  "removal  of  the  Polish  Jewish  population </p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  European  domain." The  New  York  Times  then  added,  "How  .  . .  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'removal'  of  Jews  from  Poland  [can  be  achieved]  without  their  extermination </p>
<p class="calibre1">... is not explained."42 </p>
<p class="calibre1">SEPTEMBER 9, 1939 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Thomas J. Watson, President </p>

<p class="calibre1">New York NY USA </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dear Mr. Watson: </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  your  last  visit  in  Berlin  at  the  beginning  of  July,  you  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  kind  offer  to  me  that  you  might  be  willing  to  furnish  the  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">company  machines  from  Endicott  in  order  to  shorten  our  long  delivery </p>
<p class="calibre1">terms.  I...  asked  you  to  leave  with  us  for  study  purposes  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabetic  tabulating  machine  and  a  collator  out  of  the  American </p>
<p class="calibre1">machines  at  present  in  Germany.  You  have  complied  with  this  request, </p>

<p class="calibre1">urgent need, I may make use of other American machines.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  will  understand  that  under  today's  conditions,  a  certain  need </p>
<p class="calibre1">has  arisen  for  such  machines,  which  we  do  not  build  as  yet  in  Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  I  should  like  to  make  use  of  your  kind  offer  and  ask  you  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">leave  with  the  German  company  for  the  time  being  the  alphabetic  tab- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulating machines which are at present still in the former Austria.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding  the  payment,  I  cannot  make  any  concrete  proposals  at  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">moment,  however,  I  should  ask  you  to  be  convinced  that  I  shall  see  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  that  a  fair  reimbursement  for  the  machines  left  with  us  will  be  made </p>
<p class="calibre1">when there will be a possibility. ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">...  [A]t  the  time  that  the  German  production  of  these  machines  ren- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ders  it  possible,  we  shall  place  at  your  disposal...  a  German  machine </p>
<p class="calibre1">for each American machine left with us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  offer,  made  orally  by  you,  dear  Mr.  Watson  ...  will  undoubtedly </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  greatly  appreciated  in  many  and  especially  responsible  circles.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  should  thank  you  if  you  would  ask  your  Geneva  organization,  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  same  time,  to  furnish  us  the  necessary  repair  parts  for  the  mainte- </p>

<p class="calibre1">IBM's  alphabetizer,  principally  its  model  405,  was  introduced  in  1934, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  it  did  not  become  widely  used  until  it  was  perfected  in  conjunction  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Social  Security  Administration.  The  elaborate  alphabetizer  was  the  pride </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  IBM.  Sleek  and  more  encased  than  earlier  Holleriths,  the  complex  405 </p>
<p class="calibre1">integrated  several  punch  card  mechanisms  into  a  single,  high-speed  device.  A </p>
<p class="calibre1">summary  punch  cable  connector  at  its  bottom  facilitated  the  summarizing  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">voluminous  tabulated  results  onto  a  single  summary  card.  A  short  card  feed </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  adjacent  stacker  at  the  machine's  top  was  attached  to  a  typewriter-style </p>
<p class="calibre1">printing  unit  equipped  with  an  automatic  carriage  to  print  out  the  alphabet- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ized  results.  Numerous  switches,  dials,  reset  keys,  a  control  panel,  and  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  attached  reading  table,  made  the  405  a  very  expensive  and  versatile </p>
<p class="calibre1">device.  By  1939,  the  squat  405  was  IBM's  dominant  machine  in  the  United </p>
<p class="calibre1">States.  However,  the  complex  statistical  instrument  was  simply  too  expensive </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  European  market.  Indeed,  in  1935,  the  company  was  still  exhibiting  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">at  business  shows.44  Because  the  405  required  so  many  raw  materials,  includ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  rationed  metals  that  Dehomag  could  not  obtain,  IBM's  alphabetizer  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">simply out of reach for the Nazi Reich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the 405 was of prime importance to Germany for its critical ability </p>
<p class="calibre1">to create alphabetized lists and its speed for general tabulation. The 405 </p>
<p class="calibre1">could calculate 1.2 million implicit multiplications in just 42 hours. By com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">parison, the slightly older model 601 would need 800 hours for the same </p>
<p class="calibre1">task —fundamentally an impossible assignment.45 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  than  1,000  405s  were  operating  in  American  government  bureaus </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  corporate  offices,  constituting  one  of  the  company's  most  profitable </p>
<p class="calibre1">inventions. But few of the expensive devices were anywhere in Europe. Previ- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ously, Dehomag was only  able to provide such machines to key  governmental </p>
<p class="calibre1">agencies  direcdy  from  America  or  through  its  other  European  subsidiaries—a </p>
<p class="calibre1">costly  financial  foreign  exchange  transaction,  which  also  required  the  specific </p>
<p class="calibre1">permission of Watson. Germany had taken over Poland and war had been </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared  in  Europe.  Such  imports  from  America  were  no  longer  possible.  But </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  wanted  the  precious  alphabetizing  equipment  still  in  Austria:  five </p>
<p class="calibre1">variously  configured  alphabetical  punches,  two  alphabetical  interpreters,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">six  alphabetical  printing  tabulators,  as  well  as  one  collator.  However,  these </p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable assets were still owned and controlled by the prior IBM subsidiary.46 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  would  not  transfer  the  assets  or  give  the  Austrian  machines  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  without  something  in  return.  The  exchanges  began  by  a  return  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  issue  of  Heidinger's  demand  to  sell  his  stock  if  he  could  not  receive </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  bonuses  he  was  entitled  to.  Watson  tried  to  defuse  the  confrontation  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly  agreeing  to  advance  Heidinger  the  monies  he  needed.  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote  Rottke,  "When  I  was  in  Germany  recently  and  talked  to  Mr.  Heidinger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he  gave  me  to  understand  that  he  was  in  need  of  some  money  to  meet  his </p>
<p class="calibre1">living  expenses.  As  a  stockholder  in  your  Company,  I  am  writing  this  letter </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  advise  you  that  it  will  be  agreeable  to  us  for  you  to  lend  Mr.  Heidinger </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  amounts  as  you  think  he  will  require  to  take  care  of  his  living  ex- </p>
<p class="calibre1">penses."47  Watson's  letter,  of  course,  expressed  his  incidental  approval  as  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">mere  stockholder—not  as  the  controlling  force  in  the  company—this  to  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinue the fiction that Dehomag was not foreign-controlled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  very  moment  Watson  was  dictating  his  letter  about  Heidinger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany  was  involved  in  a  savage  occupation  of  Poland.  WWII  was  under- </p>
<p class="calibre1">way.  So  Watson  was  careful.  He  did  not  date  the  letter  to  Rottke,  or  even </p>
<p class="calibre1">send  it  directly  to  Germany.  Instead,  the  correspondence  was  simply  handed </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  his  secretary.  She  then  mailed  the  authorizing  letter  to  an  IBM  auditor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">J.  C.  Milner  in  Geneva,  with  a  note  advising,  "I  have  been  instructed  by  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  to  forward  the  enclosed  letter  for  Mr.  Hermann  Rottke  to  your  care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would  you  kindly  see  that  the  letter  reaches  him."  The  undated  copy  filed  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson's  office,  however,  was  date-stamped  "September  13,  1939"  for  filing </p>
<p class="calibre1">purposes.48 </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Heidinger  was  not  interested  in  further  advances,  as  these  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">deepened  his  tax  dilemma.  He  wanted  the  alphabetizes  and  made  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">known  to  J.  W.  Schotte,  IBM's  newly  promoted  European  general  manager  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  who  acted  as  Watson's  intermediary  on  the  alphabetizer  question.  On </p>
<p class="calibre1">September  27,  1939,  the  day  a  vanquished  Poland  formally  capitulated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  telephoned  Rottke  and  a  Dehomag  management  team  in  Berlin  to  re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gretfully  explain  that  Watson  refused  to  transfer  the  alphabetizes.  Instead, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson  merely  offered  to  arrange  for  Dehomag  to  take  possession  of  thirty- </p>
<p class="calibre1">four  broken  alphabetizers  returned  from  Russia  and  lying  dormant  in  a  Ham- </p>
<p class="calibre1">burg warehouse. They could be repaired and rehabilitated back into service.49 </p>
<p class="calibre1">An indignant Rottke refused "most energetically on the grounds that </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are 'old junk' in which we are not the least interested."  Schotte upped </p>
<p class="calibre1">the offer, saying Watson warned Dehomag to take over the entire Russian ter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ritory. Rottke thought the prospect in principle seemed rather attractive </p>
<p class="calibre1">because Dehomag could then gain foreign exchange. But, thought Rottke, all </p>
<p class="calibre1">the benefits of Russian sales would be negated if the German subsidiary was </p>
<p class="calibre1">still compelled to pay IBM NY a 25 percent royalty. Preferring not to verbal- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ize any of that, Rottke simply replied to Schotte that any ideas on servicing </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Russian market should be expressed in writing.50 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning  to  the  alphabetizes,  Rottke  repeatedly  insisted  Schotte  call </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson to recommend that he "let us have these few machines." Schotte would </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  budge,  saying  they  had  been  "set  aside  for  urgent  needs."  From  Rottke's </p>
<p class="calibre1">view,  the  machines  were  in  Nazi-annexed  Austria,  a  territory  now  granted  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag,  and  Watson  would  not  let  the  Germans  deploy  the  existing  ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines?  Incensed  and  threatening,  Rottke  told  Schotte,  "IBM  is  big  enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  take  care  of  its  customers,"  adding,  "depriving  us  of  these  few  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">might  later  be  regretted."  Schotte  saw  that  Rottke's  limit  was  being  reached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He promised to call Watson again and convey the sentiment in Berlin.51 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte called Rottke the next morning, September 28, in friendly spir- </p>
<p class="calibre1">its. It was all just a mistake on Watson's part, he was happy to say. Watson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">claimed Schotte, thought the machines had never even been delivered to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austria. Watson had backed down again. Rottke was able to send a letter to </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heidinger confirming that Dehomag is "keeping the machines I had asked </p>
<p class="calibre1">for until further notice."52 </p>

<p class="calibre1">Just  a  week  before,  on  September  21,  1939,  Reinhard  Heydrich,  Chief </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Himmler's  Security  Service,  the  SD,  held  a  secret  conference  in  Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Summarizing  the  decisions  taken  that  day,  he  circulated  a  top  secret  Express </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letter to the chiefs of his Einsatzgruppen operating in the occupied territories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ruthless  Einsatzgruppen  were  special  mobile  task  forces  that  fanned  out </p>
<p class="calibre1">through conquered lands sadistically murdering as many Jews as they could as </p>
<p class="calibre1">fast  as  they  could.  Frequendy,  Jews  were  herded  and  locked  into  synagogues, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  were  then  set  ablaze  as  the  people  inside  hopelessly  tried  to  escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More often, families were marched to trenches where the victims, many clutch- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing their young ones, were lined up, mercilessly shot in assembly line fashion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  then  dumped  into  the  earth  by  the  hundreds.54  But  these  methods  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">too sporadic and too inefficient to quickly destroy millions of people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heydrich's  September  21  memo  was  captioned:  "The  Jewish  Question </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  Occupied  Territory."  It  began,  "With  reference  to  the  conference  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">took  place  today  in  Berlin,  I  would  like  to  point  out  once  more  that  the  total </p>
<p class="calibre1">measures  planned  (i.e.,  the  final  aim)  are  to  be  kept  strictly  secret."  Heydrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">underlined  the  words  "total  measures  planned"  and  "stricdy  secret."  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">parentheses, he used the German word Endziel for "final aim."55 </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  memo  continued:  "A  distinction  is  to  be  made  between  1)  The  final </p>
<p class="calibre1">aim  (which  will  take  some  time)  and  2)  sections  of  the  carrying  out  of  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">goal  (which  can  be  carried  out  in  a  short  space  of  time).  The  measures </p>
<p class="calibre1">planned  require  the  most  thorough  preparation  both  from  the  technical  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  economic  point  of  view.  It  goes  without  saying  that  the  tasks  in  this  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nection cannot be laid down in detail."56 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The very next step, the memo explained, was population control. First, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews were to be relocated from their homes to so-called "concentration towns." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish communities of less than 500 persons were dissolved and consolidated </p>
<p class="calibre1">into the larger sites. "Care must be taken," wrote Heydrich, "that only such </p>
<p class="calibre1">towns be chosen as concentration points as are either railroad junctions or at </p>
<p class="calibre1">least lie on a railway." Addressing the zone covered by Einsatzgruppe I, which </p>
<p class="calibre1">extended from east of Krakow to the former Slovak-Polish border, Heydrich </p>
<p class="calibre1">directed, "Within this territory, only a temporary census of Jews need be taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rest is to be done by the Jewish Council of Elders dealt with below."57 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  plan,  each  Jewish  ghetto  or  concentration  town  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">compelled to appoint its own Council of Elders, generally rabbis and other </p>
<p class="calibre1">prominent  personalities,  who  would  be  required  to  swiftly  organize  and  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">age the ghetto residents. Each council would become known as a Judenrat, or </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish Council. "The Jewish Councils," Heydrich's memo instructed his units, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"are to undertake a temporary census of the Jews, if possible, arranged accord- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing to sex [ages: (a) up to 16 years, (b) from 16 to 20 years, and (c) over], </p>
<p class="calibre1">and according to the principal professions in their localities, and to report </p>
<p class="calibre1">thereon within the shortest possible period."58 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  in  the  ghetto,  the  instruction  declared,  Jews  would  be  "forbid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">den  to  leave  the  ghetto,  forbidden  to  go  out  after  a  certain  hour  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">evening, etc."59 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heydrich demanded that "the chiefs of the Einsatzgruppen report to me </p>
<p class="calibre1">continually regarding . . . the census of Jews in their districts. . . . The num- </p>
<p class="calibre1">bers  are  to  be  divided  into  Jews  who  will  be  migrating  from  the  country,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">those who are already in the towns."60 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  3  million  Polish  Jews,  during  a  sequence  of  sudden  relocations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  to  be  catalogued  for  further  action  in  a  massive  cascade  of  repetitive </p>
<p class="calibre1">censuses,  registrations,  and  inventories  with  up-to-date  information  being </p>
<p class="calibre1">instantly  available  to  various  Nazi  planning  agencies  and  military  occupation </p>
<p class="calibre1">offices.61  How  much  food  would  the  Jews  require?  How  much  usable  forced </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor  for  armament  factories  and  useful  skills  could  they  generate?  How </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  thousands  would  die  from  month  to  month  under  the  new  starvation </p>
<p class="calibre1">regimen?  Under  wartime  conditions,  it  would  be  a  marvel  of  population  reg- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istration—a statistical feat. No time was to be lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reich was ready. During summer 1939, the Office for Military- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Economic Planning, with jurisdiction over Hollerith usage, had conducted its </p>
<p class="calibre1">own study of the ethnic minorities in Poland. By November 2, 1939, Arlt, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics wizard who had already surveyed Leipzig Jews and their city-by- </p>
<p class="calibre1">city ancestral roots in Poland, had been appointed head of the Population </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Welfare  Administration  of  the  "General  Government,"  the  new  Reich </p>
<p class="calibre1">name  for  occupied  Poland.  Arlt  was  devoted  to  population  registrations,  race </p>
<p class="calibre1">science issues, and population politics. He edi t e d  his own statistical publica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion, Volkspolitischer Informationsdienst der Regierungen des Generalgouvern- </p>
<p class="calibre1">merits  (Political  Information  Service  of  the  General  Government),  based  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krakow.  It  featured  such  detailed  data  as  Jewish  population  per  square  meter </p>
<p class="calibre1">with  sliding  projections  of  decrease  resulting  from  such  imposed  conditions </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  forced  labor  and  starvation.  Arlt  ruled  out  permanent  emigration,  since </p>
<p class="calibre1">this  would  only  keep  Jews  in  existence.  Instead,  one  article  asserts,  "We  can </p>
<p class="calibre1">count  on  the  mortality  of  some  subjugated  groups.  These  include  babies  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">those over the age of 65, as well as those who are basically weak and ill in all </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  age  groups."  Only  eliminating  1.5  million  Jews  would  reduce  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">density </p>
<p class="calibre1">to </p>
<p class="calibre1">110 </p>
<p class="calibre1">persons </p>
<p class="calibre1">per </p>
<p class="calibre1">square </p>
<p class="calibre1">kilometer.62 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In October 1939, the next counts began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">UNLIKE  GERMAN,  Austrian,  and  Czech  Jewry,  most  of  Polish  Jewry  was  not </p>
<p class="calibre1">assimilated.  Intensely  religious  and  not  infrequendy  cloistered  into  very  sepa- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  communities,  they  were  often  discernible  by  certain  physical  features </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Eastern  Europeans  associated  with  Jews.  Characteristic  dark  beards  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">other  facial  attributes  made  their  appearance  very  different  from  many  Poles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Openly  speaking  Yiddish  and  Germanic  dialects  only  set  them  further  apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  neighborhoods,  Jews  wore  traditional  attire.  Persecuted  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">portable  professions,  Jews  inhabited  the  merchant  class  and  artisan  crafts.  In- </p>
<p class="calibre1">deed,  the  Polish  word  for  "commerce"  was  the  German  word  handel,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews  had  Yiddishized.  With  well-developed  schools  and  other  institutions,  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">well  as  a  unifying  corporate  communal  body,  a  flourishing  Jewish  and  Yid- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dish  culture  thrived  in  Poland.  The  Jews  of  Poland  were  often  highly  recog- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nizable  and  frequendy  resembled  the  stereotypical  notion  anti-Semites </p>
<p class="calibre1">harbored.  In  short,  one  didn't  need  a  punch  card-driven  census  to  identify </p>
<p class="calibre1">most of Polish Jewry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  for  special  measures  Hitler  had  in  mind,  the  Jews  of  Poland  did </p>
<p class="calibre1">need  to  be  counted  and  their  possessions  inventoried.  Moreover,  the  Nazis </p>
<p class="calibre1">did  need  to  identify  the  thousands  of  Jews  who  did  not  fit  the  physical  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">social  stereotypes,  had  drifted  away  from  the  communal  group  or  its  neigh- </p>
<p class="calibre1">borhoods,  had  become  baptized,  or  who  had  simply  assimilated  successfully </p>
<p class="calibre1">into overall society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  Germany  invaded  Poland,  the  vibrant  Jewish  existence  there  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly obliterated. First, as instructed by Heydrich, Nazi forces created </p>
<p class="calibre1">Judenrate, that is, Jewish Councils, across the country. In Warsaw, where a </p>
<p class="calibre1">third of the city's million-plus residents were Jewish, a balding engineer </p>
<p class="calibre1">named Adam Czerniakow was abruptly appointed chairman of the local </p>
<p class="calibre1">Judenrat. Undoubtedly, he was chosen for his methodical, engineering mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czerniakow and his council of twenty-four handpicked elders were charged </p>
<p class="calibre1">with managing all civic affairs of the trapped Jewish population. It was the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Council's responsibility to gain rigid compliance with the torrent of oppressive </p>
<p class="calibre1">measures decreed by the Nazis as the Reich speedily dismanded the once- </p>
<p class="calibre1">thriving community of some 375,000 Warsaw Jews. In their impossible task, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Judenrats every move was closely regulated by the Gestapo, SS, Einsatz- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gruppen,  and  other  Nazi  bodies.  Nazi  officers  sometimes  lurked  just  a  few </p>
<p class="calibre1">feet  away  at  the  window  as  Czerniakow  worked  in  his  office.63 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistics,  registrations,  and  census  would  be  an  all-consuming  duty  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czerniakow </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">his </p>
<p class="calibre1">council </p>
<p class="calibre1">during </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming </p>
<p class="calibre1">days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  4,  1939,  Czerniakow  was  called  to  the  Einsatzgruppe  offices </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  Szuch  Avenue.  As instructed,  he immediately  went  to  work  on  a statistical </p>
<p class="calibre1">questionnaire.  He  continued  to  meet  with  Nazi  officials  daily.  Each  time  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  summoned,  he  noted  their  escalating,  almost  non-negotiable  demands </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  commands.  October  7,  the  issue  of  statistics  came  up  again.  October  12, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  a  meeting  with  the  SS,  Czerniakow  reviewed  questions  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">community's  finances,  forced  labor  contingents,  and  the  forms  to  be  used  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">record  data.  October  13,  in  meetings  with  the  SS,  Czerniakow  again  con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ferred on statistics wanted by the Germans and the forms to be used.64 </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  swiftly  transfer  the  Jews  out  of  their  homes  and  businesses  across </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warsaw  and  compress  them  into  a  small  prison-like  neighborhood  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">major  population  transfer  that  required  detailed  planning.  The  Nazis  were </p>
<p class="calibre1">already  gathering  house-by-house  lists  of  residents  from  German-appointed </p>
<p class="calibre1">"courtyard  commandants,"  this  ostensibly  to  qualify  occupants  for  food  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">city  where  nearly  all  water,  electricity,  and  transportation  had  ceased.  In </p>
<p class="calibre1">addition,  the  Judenrat  was  required  to  compile  lists  of  all  Warsaw  Jews </p>
<p class="calibre1">between the ages of sixteen and sixty.65 </p>
<p class="calibre1">None  of  it  was  fast  enough  or  complete  enough.  On  October  14,  Ein- </p>
<p class="calibre1">satzgruppen  officers  ordered  the Judenrat  to conduct a  full Jewish census  bro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ken  down  by  city  district.  Somehow,  the  Judenrat  would  also  have  to  identify </p>
<p class="calibre1">the baptized Jews who were not part of the Jewish community.66 </p>
<p class="calibre1">German  statistical  officials  already  possessed  the  published  figures  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Jewish  population  from  the  1931  general  Polish  census.  That  census  rou- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tinely  recorded  citizens  by  religion  and  mother  tongue.  So  the  Nazis  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">easily estimate that about 350,000 Jews lived in Warsaw. But many had fled as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Blitzkried  advanced  into  the  Polish  heartland  and  during  the  years  of  pre- </p>
<p class="calibre1">war  anti-Jewish  agitation.  Berlin  needed  precise  numbers.  They  didn't  care </p>
<p class="calibre1">how. The Nazis demanded Czerniakow plan and execute the census taking.67 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day,  as  Czerniakow  prepared  for  his  task,  Einsatzgruppe  offi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cers  and  their  Polish-born  auxiliaries  patrolling  the  Jewish  quarters  contin- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ued  to  sadistically  terrorize  Jews  directly  outside  his  office.  Their  favorite </p>
<p class="calibre1">sport  was  pouncing  on  defenseless,  pious  Jews  walking  the  streets  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstratively  cutting  off  their  beards.  Other  times,  they  forced  Jews  down </p>
<p class="calibre1">on  all  fours  and  then  ordered  neighbors  to  ride  them  like  donkeys  in  a  race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brutality  to  Jews  on  holy  days  or  just  before  the  Sabbath  was  the  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">intense.  Pork  and  butter  were  smeared  across  their  lips  to  violate  their  kosher </p>
<p class="calibre1">observance.  Soldiers  snapped  endless  photos  of  the  merriment  for  keepsakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  such  outrages  took  place  outside  his  window,  Czerniakow  struggled  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">outline the logistics of the census.68 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  16,  at  5  A.M.,  Czerniakow  resumed  working  on  census  tak- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  logistics  and  the  questionnaire.  On  October  17,  Czerniakow  rose  at  dawn </p>
<p class="calibre1">to begin a day of meetings to explain his duties, including a stop at the Polish </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical  Office  to confer  with its  staff.  On  October  19,  another  meeting  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">held at the Polish Statistical Office.69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  20,  an  Einsatzgruppen  officer  came  to  the  Jewish  Commu- </p>
<p class="calibre1">nity  Center  for  a  3  P.M.  meeting  with  Czerniakow,  but  the  Judenrat  chairman </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  already  gone  to  the  Security  Police  headquarters  for  the  meeting.  It  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  mix-up.  Czerniakow  was  threatened  with  retaliation  unless  he  came  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly.  By  5  P.M.,  Czerniakow  was  summoned  to  yet  another  meeting,  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">one  with the  SS,  again to review  census  plans.  Of the  several  competing  Nazi </p>
<p class="calibre1">entities  occupying  Warsaw,  the  SS  decided  its  group  would  issue  the  census </p>
<p class="calibre1">proclamation.70 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  21,  Czerniakow  met  with  officials  from  noon  until  2  P.M.  at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Polish  Statistical  Office.  From  3  P.M.  until  6  P.M.  he  was  at  the  SS  again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hammering  out  plans  for  the  census.  During  the  difficult  conference,  Czerni- </p>
<p class="calibre1">akow  tried  to  explain  that  the  operation  should  be  postponed  until  early </p>
<p class="calibre1">November  3—but  the  Nazis  refused  to  wait  that  long.  Czerniakow  was  sent </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  another  official  for  a  protracted,  stressful  conference  and  then  ordered  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct  the  census  within  one  week,  on  October  28,  and  at  Jewish  expense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  time  to  deploy  an  army  of  census  takers.  Instead,  Jews  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">be  ordered  to  appear  at  local  census  sites  to  fill  out  their  forms.  Czerniakow </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  dispatched  to  the  Currency  Control  Office  where  officials  unblocked </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  frozen  Jewish  accounts  to  defray  census  costs,  such  as  printing  ques- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tionnaires. Czerniakow then rushed to meet a printer and together they hur- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ried to the printing shop to discuss the final format of the questionnaires </p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded by the Germans, as well as posters announcing the count. It was </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czernaikow's responsibility to drive throughout the city that night hanging </p>
<p class="calibre1">the announcement posters so they were visible in the morning. Very late that </p>
<p class="calibre1">day, fatigued and disconsolate, trying to reconcile with his God, Czerniakow </p>
<p class="calibre1">finally returned home. He vomited.71 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the morning, Czerniakow continued preparations for the census, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including naming twenty-six commissioners to oversee its thoroughness and </p>
<p class="calibre1">reliability. The SS had a habit of taking hostages when compliance was </p>
<p class="calibre1">required.72 These men would surely be held responsible if anything went </p>
<p class="calibre1">amiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  23,  SS  officers  came  to  the  Jewish  Community  Center  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">monitor  the  Judenrat's  plans  to  execute  the  count.  October  26,  at  1  P.M., </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czerniakow  toured  census  stations  all  over  the  city.  Czerniakow  spent  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next  day  making  final  preparations,  conferring  with  the  census  commission- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers and attending to last-minute details.73 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaim  Kaplan  was  one  of  Warsaw  Jewry's  many  eloquent  men  of  letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  teacher,  poet,  and  journalist,  Kaplan  had  traveled  to  America  and  Palestine </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  pre-War  years.  In  his  diary,  on  October  21,  he  wrote,  "Some  time </p>
<p class="calibre1">ago,  I  stated  that  our  future  is  beclouded.  I  was  wrong.  Our  future  is  becom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  increasingly  clear."  He  added,  "blessed  be  the  righteous  judge,"  the  tradi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tional invocation chanted at funerals and upon hearing of a death.74 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  25,  Kaplan  recorded,  "Another  sign  that  bodes  ill:  Today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">notices  informed  the  Jewish  population  of  Warsaw  that  next  Saturday  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  be  a  census  of  the  Jewish  inhabitants.  .  .  .  Our  hearts  tell  us  of  evil— </p>
<p class="calibre1">some  catastrophe  for  the  Jews  of  Warsaw  lies  in  this  census.  Otherwise  there </p>
<p class="calibre1">would be no need for it."75 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kaplan  had  witnessed  rabbis  brutally  beaten  and  their  beards  forcibly </p>
<p class="calibre1">cut.  He  had  seen  elderly  women  yanked  at  the  jaw  with  riding  crops.  Inno- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent  people  were  compelled  to  dance  atop  tables  for  hours  on  end.  On  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">day  of  the  census,  Kaplan  wrote,  "These  people  must  be  considered  psy- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chopaths  and  sadists,  because  normal  people  are  incapable  of  such  abom- </p>
<p class="calibre1">inable  acts.  ..  ."  He  also  wrote:  "The  order  for  a  census  stated  that  it  is  being </p>
<p class="calibre1">held  to  gather  data  for  administrative  purposes.  That's  a  neat  phrase,  but  it </p>
<p class="calibre1">contains  catastrophe....  We  are  certain  that  this  census  is  being  taken  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose  of  expelling  'nonproductive  elements'  And  there  are  a  great  many  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">us now.... We are all caught in a net, doomed to destruction."76 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kaplan  was  not  alone  in  fearing  the  census.  Czerniakow  was  besieged </p>
<p class="calibre1">with questions about the purpose of this count.77 The deeply Talmudic com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">munity,  which  had  little  left  except  its  faith  and  teachings,  understood  well </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  censuses  were  ominous  in  Jewish  history.  The  Bible  itself  taught  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">unless  specifically  ordered  by  God,  the  census  is  evil  because  through  it  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy will know your strength: </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  Chronicles  21:  Satan  rose  up  against  Israel  and  incited  David  to  take  a  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus of Israel. . . . This command was also evil in the sight of God. . . Then David </p>
<p class="calibre1">said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now I beg you to take away </p>
<p class="calibre1">the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."78 </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  October  28,  1939,  for  the  Jewish  people  of  Warsaw,  everything </p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped. That day they were counted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout  the  day,  thousands  of  census  forms  were  brought  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish  Community  Center,  generally  by  the  house  superintendents  in  Jewish </p>
<p class="calibre1">buildings.79 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  results  came  with  almost  magical  speed.  In  a  little  more  than  forty- </p>
<p class="calibre1">eight  hours,  all  the  forms  had  been  counted.  By  October  31,  Czerniakow  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">been  informed  there  were  some  360,000  Jews  in  Warsaw.  The  exact  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  359,827,  revealing  the  community's  precise  dimensions:  Jews  infancy  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">age  15:  ...  46,172  men  and  45,439  women;  Jews  aged  16-59  ..  .  104,273 </p>
<p class="calibre1">men  and  131,784  women;  Jews  aged  60  and  over  ...  13,325  men  and  16,933 </p>
<p class="calibre1">women;  undetermined  .  .  .  only  537  men  and  1,364  women.  Employed  .  .  . </p>
<p class="calibre1">155,825.  Unemployed,  including  infants  and  invalids  .  .  .  204,002.  Artisans </p>
<p class="calibre1">..  .  73,435.  The  Germans  even  knew  that  many  Jewish  artisans  were  practic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  without  a  license  by  comparing  the  census  results  with  the  actual  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">of artisan licenses previously issued by the local authorities.80 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  day,  Czerniakow  was  ordered  to  submit  a  complete  report  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  census  within  two  weeks.  On  November  2,  even  as  crews  began  burying </p>
<p class="calibre1">masses  of  typhus  and  dysentery  victims  created  by  the  squalid  conditions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czerniakow  discovered  he  could  not  pay  all  of  the  collateral  expenses  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">census.81 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  November  20,  all  census  matters  had  been  completed,  although  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazis  were  planning  the  ghetto  to  approximate  the  outlines  of  the  already </p>
<p class="calibre1">overcrowded  Nalewki  district.  The  signs  at  its  boundary  would  read:  Ach- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tung!  Seuchengefahr.  Eintritt  verboten  (Attention:  Epidemics—Entry  Prohib- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ited).  The  seizure  of  all  Jewish  funds  was  being  readied.  But  the  Nazis  still </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted  the  baptized  Jews.  It  was  Czerniakow's  problem.  He  solved  it  some- </p>
<p class="calibre1">how  by  producing  a  list  of  Christian  converts,  which  he  handed  over  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  6,  1939.  By  December  9,  the  authorities  had  revised  their  number </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Jews  in  Warsaw  to  366,000,  the  extra  6,000  apparently  accounting  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">so-called racial Jews.82 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the Reich knew exactly how many Jews were under their jurisdic- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tion,  how  much  nutrition  to  allocate—as  low  as  184  calories  per  person  per </p>
<p class="calibre1">day.  They  could  consolidate  Jews  from  the  mixed  districts  of  Warsaw,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">bring  in  Jews  from  other  nearby  villages.  The  transports  began  arriving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">White  armbands  with  Jewish  stars  were  distributed.  Everyone,  young  or  old, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  required  to  wear  one  on  the  arm.  Not  the  forearm,  but  the  arm—visible, </p>
<p class="calibre1">above the elbow. The Warsaw-Malkinia railway line ran right through the pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">posed  ghetto.  It  was  all  according  to  Heydrich's  September  21  Express  Let- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ter.  Soon      the    demarcated    ghetto  would  be  surrounded  by  barbed  wire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, a wall went up, sealing the residents of the ghetto from the outside </p>
<p class="calibre1">world.  Soon  thereafter,  the  railway  station  would  become  the  most  feared  lo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cation in the ghetto.83 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Nazi  quantification  and  regimentation  of  Jewish  demographics  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warsaw  and  indeed  all  of  Poland  was  nothing  less  than  spectacular—an  al- </p>
<p class="calibre1">most  unbelievable  feat.  Savage  conditions,  secrecy,  and  lack  of  knowledge  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  victims  would  forever  obscure  the  details  of  exactly  how  the  Nazis  man- </p>
<p class="calibre1">aged  to  tabulate  the  cross-referenced  information  on  360,000  souls  within </p>
<p class="calibre1">forty-eight hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  this  much  is  known:  The  Third  Reich  possessed  only  one  method </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  tabulating  censuses:  Dehomag's  Hollerith  system.  Moreover,  IBM  was  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland,  headquartered  in  Warsaw.  In  fact,  the  punch  card  print  shop  was  just </p>
<p class="calibre1">yards  from  the  Warsaw  Ghetto  at  Rymarska  Street  6.  That's  where  they  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">duced more than 20 million cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WATSON  DID  NOT  really  want  Poland  until  1934.  Why?  Because  that's  when </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers  had  encroached  on  IBM  business  in  the  Polish  market.  Watson  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">not tolerate that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  were  so  few  potential  punch  card  customers  in  Poland,  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">years  before  Hitler,  that  IBM  didn't  even  maintain  a  subsidiary  there.  Wat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">son's  company  was  only  represented  by  the  independent  Block-Brun  agency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  struggling  Powers  Company  sought  its  few  customers  wherever </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  didn't  dominate,  Powers  felt  free  to  operate  in  Poland.  Then,  in  a  1934 </p>
<p class="calibre1">sales coup, Powers convinced the Polish Ministry of Posts to replace its Holle- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rith equipment with rival Powers' machines.84 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  Patterson  believed  all  cash  register  business  "belonged"  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">NCR,  Watson  believed  all  punch  card  business  innately  "belonged"  to  IBM. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  IBM  lost  the  Polish  postal  service,  Watson  reacted  at  once.  First,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">replaced the Block-Brun agency with a full-fledged IBM subsidiary named </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polski  Hollerith.85  But  who  would  run  the   new  subsidiary?  Watson  wanted </p>
<p class="calibre1">J. W. Schotte. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jurriaan  W.  Schotte  was  born  in  Amsterdam  in  1896,  just  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">time  Herman  Hollerith  incorporated  his  original  tabulating  company.  Schotte </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  eminendy  qualified  for  the  international  punch  card  business.  His  back </p>
<p class="calibre1">ground  included  civil  engineering  and  military  service.  He  was  fluent  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutch,  French,  and  German,  and  could  speak  some  Romanian  and  Malay.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  traveled  extensively  throughout  Europe,  and  enjoyed  good  commercial </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  governmental  connections.  After  a  stint  at  the  Dutch  Consulate  in  Mini- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ster,  Germany,  he  was  employed  by  Dutch  import-export  companies  in  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  San  Francisco,  and  the  East  Indies.  He  knew  manufacturing,  having </p>
<p class="calibre1">managed  a  factory  in  Belgium.  Schotte  was  perfect  for  another  reason:  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  Powers'  European  sales  manager.  Schotte  was  the  one  who  had  sold  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers machines to the Polish Post Office.86 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  had  worked  his  way  up  through  the  Powers  organization.  Start- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  as  a  factory  inspector  at  its  U.S.  affiliate,  he  had  risen  to  maintenance </p>
<p class="calibre1">supervisor  and  instructor  throughout  Europe.  A  fierce  sales  competitor,  he </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  deftly  operated  out  of  Powers'  offices  in  Paris,  Vienna,  and  Berlin.  Most </p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable,  Schotte  knew  all  of  Powers'  customers  and  prospects  throughout </p>
<p class="calibre1">the continent.87 </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  1934,  however,  Dehomag  had  so  thoroughly  squeezed  Powers  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany,  including  its  lawsuit  for  falsely  claiming  to  be  an  Aryan  concern, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Schotte  admitted  he  had  "nowhere  to  go  but  out."  He  traveled  to  New </p>
<p class="calibre1">York  to  meet  with  J.T.  Wilson,  the  head  of  IBM  NY's  Foreign  Trade  Depart- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ment.  Schotte  hoped  to  salvage  his  career  by  becoming  a  European  represen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tative  for  IBM.  Wilson  was  unsure.  Schotte  brought  a  great  deal  of  insider </p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge,  but  he  had  been  the  bitter  competition  for  some  time.  So  Wilson </p>
<p class="calibre1">only  tentatively  hired  Schotte,  and  then  cabled  the  various  subsidiaries  ask- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing their opinion.88 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reports  were  not  good.  Heidinger  curtly  dismissed  the  suggestion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling  Schotte  "an  unscrupulous  price-cutter."  IBM's  Geneva  office  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">equally  unenthusiastic.  But  Watson  thought  otherwise—Schotte  was  just  what </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  needed  in  the  new  Europe.  During  a  meeting  in  Watson's  office,  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatically  painted  a  tantalizing  picture  of  the  future  of  Europe,  one  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">excited  Schotte  because  he  could  play  a  central role  in  IBM's  plans.  He  could </p>
<p class="calibre1">return  to  Europe  as  IBM's  Manager  for  Southeast  Europe  with  a  handsome </p>
<p class="calibre1">compensation  package.  Schotte  was  later  described  as  "in  awe"  and  "walking </p>
<p class="calibre1">over  clouds"  as  the  meeting  ended  and  he  stepped  to  the  door  of  Watson's </p>
<p class="calibre1">office. But his euphoria was cut short when Watson abrupdy declared, "Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  your  employment  in  IBM  depends  on  your  getting  IBM  machines </p>
<p class="calibre1">back into the Polish Postal Service."89 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schotte  sailed  back  to  Europe  and,  as  Watson  had  insisted,  persuaded </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Polish  Postal  Service  to  switch  back  to  Hollerith  machines.90  Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">would have Poland again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler also wanted Poland. Nazi doctrine had long called for the con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">quest of Polish territory, the subjugation of its people as inferiors, and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction of its more than three million Jewish citizens that comprised the </p>
<p class="calibre1">largest Jewish community in Europe. Moreover, the Reich was determined </p>
<p class="calibre1">to confiscate Poland's significant natural resources and industry, including </p>
<p class="calibre1">timber, coke, coal, and steel making in Upper Silesia. Upper Silesia was adja- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cent  to  the  Sudeten  region  and  many  Volksdeutsche  lived  in  its  cities.  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">considered the area German. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By 1935, the year of the Nuremberg racial laws, Polski Hollerith had </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened a card punching service bureau in Warsaw. The next year, IBM opened </p>
<p class="calibre1">a second Polish office, this one in the Upper Silesian city of Katowice, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">then a card printing facility in Warsaw serving a customer base requiring </p>
<p class="calibre1">36 million cards per year. In 1937, Polski Hollerith signed the Polish Min- </p>
<p class="calibre1">istry of Railroads. That year, IBM changed its name to Watson Business Ma- </p>
<p class="calibre1">chines sp. z. o.o. and appointed an IBM salesman of Polish extraction, Janusz </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zaporski, as temporary manager. Ironically, although IBM owned and con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">trolled 100 percent of the company, as he had done so often before, Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">chose to register the stock not in the company's name, but in the name of his </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva managers. In this case, it was IBM Europe General Manager John </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holt and IBM's Geneva auditor J. C. Milner, as well as a token share—the </p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent of $200—in the name of a Polish national. By the time the com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">pany changed names to Watson Business Machines sp. z. o.o in 1937, IBM had </p>
<p class="calibre1">garnered only twenty-five customers in Poland. But the list included some of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the country's most vital industry giants, such as the Baildon steelworks. More </p>
<p class="calibre1">importantly, by this time, the subsidiary had organized the nation's freight </p>
<p class="calibre1">cars and locomotives, and through the Polish Postal Service could control </p>
<p class="calibre1">access to every address in Poland.91 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After Hitler invaded Poland in September 1939, IBM NY awarded the </p>
<p class="calibre1">lucrative Upper Silesia industrial territory to Dehomag, negotiating the dis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">position of each of the pre-existing machines. Then Watson recast his Polish </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiary as an Aryan entity by re-incorporating as a German company and </p>
<p class="calibre1">affixing a German language name, Watson Biiromaschinen GmbH, with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">recognizable, German incorporation suffix. The office in war-torn Warsaw </p>
<p class="calibre1">was moved to Kreuz 23, and the company appointed a German manager, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexander von Dehn. Von Dehn was only in charge of the remnant Polish ter- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ritory, that is, the vanquished and subjugated remainder known in Hitler par- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lance  as  the  "General  Government."  All  but  two  of  the  previous  Polish </p>
<p class="calibre1">customers  of  the  remnant  subsidiary  had  disappeared,  since  the  Polish  infra- </p>
<p class="calibre1">structure ceased to exist except as a vassal to the Germans.92 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,  after  adjusting  for  the  effects  of  the  invasion,  the  subsidiary  thrived </p>
<p class="calibre1">for  years  under  the  murderous  Nazi  regime.  IBM's  German  or  Polish  subsidi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">aries,  separately  or  in  tandem,  serviced  the  occupying  Nazi  needs  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  German  military's  constandy  changing  punch  card  agency,  which  ulti- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mately  became  known  as  Maschinelles  Berichtwesen  (MB),  or  the  Office  for </p>
<p class="calibre1">Automated  Reporting.  The  MB  maintained  Polish  field  offices  in  Posen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krakow, Stettin, and Danzig. Each MB office was typically equipped with one </p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabetical  tabulator  and  duplicator,  ten  alphabetical  punchers  and  proof- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ers,  eight  magnetic  punchers  and  proofers,  one  D-11  tabulator  with  summary </p>
<p class="calibre1">capabilities,  and  two  or  three  sorters.  One  or  two  Wehrmacht  officers  super- </p>
<p class="calibre1">vised  a  typical  support  staff  of  several  dozen  as  well  as  one  or  two  on-site </p>
<p class="calibre1">so-called  Hollerith  experts.  Dehomag  itself  was  in  charge  of  all  MB  office </p>
<p class="calibre1">training,  leasing,  upkeep,  and  custom-printed  punch  cards  and  design  of  spe- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cialized  applications.  The  projects  were  as  diverse  as  a  so-called  "horse  cen- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sus"  of  all  horses  and  mules  in  Poland,  which  would  help  move  German </p>
<p class="calibre1">elements  through  the  harsh  Polish  winter,  to  the  shipments  of  coal.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva  was  so  proud  of  the  horse  census,  conducted  in  spring  1940,  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  quickly  included  it  in  a  special  report  to  IBM's  Washington  office  de- </p>
<p class="calibre1">scribing the lucrative war profiteering of the various European subsidiaries.93 </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  years  of  Nazi-overrun  Poland,  deniability  continued  to  be  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">precious  imperative.  IBM  NY  continued  to  operate  through  its  intermedi- </p>
<p class="calibre1">aries,  nominees,  and  Geneva  managers.  It  would  always  be  able  to  say  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">unaware  of  Watson  Buromaschinen's  activities  and  the  paperwork  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly impossible to trace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  the  subsidiary's  account  at  Handlowy  Bank  in  Warsaw, </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred  to  as  "number  4B,"  was  actually  an  IBM  account,  controlled  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva.  An  administrator  later  described  the  arrangement  in  these  words: </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  this  manner,  the  IBM's  account  was  at  the  same  time  the  business  capital </p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Warsaw  company,  as  Herr  von  Dehn  was  entitled  to  take  sums  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  account  for  the  purposes  of  the  Warsaw  company."  Despite  the  horrific </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  in  Warsaw,  IBM  maintained  close  control  of  the  account  after  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion.  On  February  10,  1940,  IBM  gave  von  Dehn  written  authority  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">receive  customer  payments,  that  is,  physically  "receive"  them.  The  actual  per- </p>
<p class="calibre1">mission for von Dehn to deposit the payments in IBM's account, "after </p>
<p class="calibre1">deduction of the sums necessary for the conduct of the management," was </p>
<p class="calibre1">only oral.94 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In summer 1940, long after Hitler had invaded numerous other coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries in Kurope, and after the Warsaw Ghetto was being sealed, Watson </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted his Polish operation to stay intact. On July 29, 1940, a key official of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the IBM Geneva office, known as P. Taylor, had written to von Dehn convey- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing Watson's instruction that the families of all married men who had worked </p>
<p class="calibre1">for the subsidiary prior to the invasion should be given special financial </p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance. This subvention was to be paid from the company account. Ini- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tially, the gesture was prompted by confiscatory Nazi economic decrees and </p>
<p class="calibre1">labor restrictions, which canceled the expected Christmas 1939 bonus. Two </p>
<p class="calibre1">months pay was offered as a so-called "loan," and, as an administrator later </p>
<p class="calibre1">explained, "in order to keep up the appearance of the loan, the recipients </p>
<p class="calibre1">paid back minimal amounts each month." Von Dehn was included in the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company welfare, which exemplified the IBM ethic of taking care of "the </p>
<p class="calibre1">company's own." Such assistance encouraged loyalty from employees even </p>
<p class="calibre1">during the war. The company also granted food loans. Soon, the loan policy </p>
<p class="calibre1">was extended to unmarried employees as well. Eventually, the employee loan </p>
<p class="calibre1">program, which was similar to programs Watson had declared in other coun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tries, amounted to more than 135,000 zlotys or approximately $27,000. IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geneva also authorized small loans to its war-devastated suppliers totaling </p>
<p class="calibre1">more than 8,000 zlotys.95 </p>
<p class="calibre1">IBM  machinery  was  placed  throughout  the  General  Government,  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">cluding  two  alphabetizes  and  accessory  machines,  which  had  been  brought </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  by  the  invading  German  army.  Dehomag  rented  them  to  the  Polish  users, </p>
<p class="calibre1">retaining  25  percent  of  the  income.  The  remainder  went  to  Watson  Buro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">maschinen.  Among  the  few  remaining  clients  were  Polish  Railways  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krakow Statistical Office.96 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  subsidiary's  machinery  in  occupied  Poland  was  insured  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States.  In  1940,  von  Dehn  asked  IBM  to  increase  the  insurance  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">view  of  wartime  conditions.  But  this  would  have  involved  paperwork.  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">declined  to  do  so.97  As  for  Block-Brun,  IBM's  former  agency,  it  was  excluded </p>
<p class="calibre1">from nearly all of IBM's expansion in Poland. Block-Brun switched to Powers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  only  minor  competitor  left  in  punch  card  technology.  But  the  residual </p>
<p class="calibre1">Powers business was paltry. So Block-Brun was eager to retain a tertiary role as </p>
<p class="calibre1">a local supplier of IBM control mechanisms. An administrator who later looked </p>
<p class="calibre1">for a  written contract  with  Block-Brun  could  never  find  one. This  relationship </p>
<p class="calibre1">also appeared to be oral. Under the cloudy arrangement, IBM sold the control </p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanisms  at  Block-Brun's  own  risk,  requiring  the  Polish  agency  to  pay  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">import freight to Warsaw. These parts were not sold into Poland by  Dehomag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  directly  by  IBM  either  in  New  York  or  Europe.  Watson  required  Block- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brun  to  pay  the  import  fees.  All  sales  were  final  with  Block-Brun  immediately </p>
<p class="calibre1">assuming  ownership  once  the  apparatuses  were  ordered.  But  IBM's  terms </p>
<p class="calibre1">often  allowed  the  agency  to  pay  into  the  Bank  Handlowy  account  only  after </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  merchandise  was  sold,  generally  six  to  fifteen  months  after  receipt.98  IBM </p>
<p class="calibre1">was receiving the money for years after the invasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Block-Brun's  sales  on  behalf  of  IBM  were  often  wrongly  listed  as  "con- </p>
<p class="calibre1">signments,"  which  meant  IBM  would  have  owned  the  devices  until  sale,  paid </p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  immediately,  and  assumed  all  risk  for  war  damage.  IBM  refused  to  honor </p>
<p class="calibre1">any  appearance  of  consignment.  For  example,  in  1939,  a  shipment  worth </p>
<p class="calibre1">$12,134  was  severely  damaged.  Block-Brun  negotiated  with  IBM  for  years </p>
<p class="calibre1">before  IBM  finally  agreed to  take  the  machines  back  via  Sweden.  Due  to  war </p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions, the machines never made it back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  Nazis  invaded  Poland,  IBM  maintained  its  punch  card  printing </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation  at  Rymarska  Street  6.  Three  printing  machines  and  one  card  cutter </p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  just  two  people,  using  paper  brought  in  from  Germany.  Ultimately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  occupation  years,  the  shop  at  Rymarska  produced  as  many  as  10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">million cards per year.100 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  1939,  Rymarska  Street  6  stood  along  a  very  short,  tree-lined  lane, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite  a  plaza  fountain,  just  yards  from  the  Jewish  district  that  in  1940 </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  become  the  walled-in  Warsaw  Ghetto.  The  street  itself  had  long  pos- </p>
<p class="calibre1">sessed  a  Jewish  character.  In  1928,  before  IBM  inhabited  it,  Rymarska  6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">housed  the  Salon  for  Jewish  Art.  The  property  had  been  owned,  at  one </p>
<p class="calibre1">point,  by  the  Hirszfeld  brothers.  In  addition  to  a  gallery,  the  street  had </p>
<p class="calibre1">become  known  for  print  shops.  Rymarska  8  housed  the  Pospieszna  printer </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  "Union"  printer  was  a  few  doors  down.  But  after  the  Nazis  arrived, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews lost their property to Aryan or Polish concerns. When, in 1940, the War- </p>
<p class="calibre1">saw  Ghetto  was  walled  in,  the  often-adjusted  perimeter  cut  right  through </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rymarska  Street,  oddly  circumventing  the  print  shops  in  an  almost  U-shaped </p>
<p class="calibre1">deviation.  Rymarska  1-5  and  Rymarska  11-20  ended  up  within  the  Ghetto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rymarska  6  and  a  few  other  shops  remained  outside  the  ghetto.  Thus,  most </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the printing operations continued undisturbed.101 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Statistical  operations  resembling  the  Warsaw  census  were  established  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">ghettos  all  across  Poland.  Although  the  incessant  counts  and  voluminous </p>
<p class="calibre1">card  files  were  implemented  and  maintained  by  the  Judenrate  under  merci- </p>
<p class="calibre1">less  Nazi  coercion,  the  vital  statistics  were  not  certified  as  final  until  they </p>
<p class="calibre1">were approved by the fully equipped city statistical offices outside the ghetto </p>
<p class="calibre1">walls. Ultimately, the ghettos developed elaborate statistical  bureaus. In some </p>
<p class="calibre1">cases,  they  were  required  to  p u b l i s h   t h e i r   own  statistical  yearbooks.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czestochowa  Ghetto's  three  statistical  bulletins  in  1940  totaled  some  400 </p>
<p class="calibre1">pages </p>
<p class="calibre1">of </p>
<p class="calibre1">detailed </p>
<p class="calibre1">demographic </p>
<p class="calibre1">and </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsistence </p>
<p class="calibre1">analysis.102 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland  was  not  the  only  focal  point  for  Reich  statistical  action.  A  Statis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tical  Office  for  the  Protectorate  of  Bohemia  and  Moravia  was  opened  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prague  in  1939.  Data  services  were  also  opened  in  Upper  Silesia  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warthe  region  where  IBM  had  transferred  the  territory  to  Dehomag.103 </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  1939  invasion,  Heydrich  of  the  Security  Service,  the  official  who </p>
<p class="calibre1">had  sent  out  the  all-defining  September  21  Express  Letter,  sent  a  follow-up </p>
<p class="calibre1">cable  to  his  occupying  forces  in  Poland,  Upper  Silesia,  and  Czechoslovakia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  cable  oudined  how  a  new  census  scheduled  for  December  17,  1939, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would  escalate  the  process  from  mere  identification  and  cataloging  to  depor- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tation  and  execution  as  people  were  rapidly  moved  into  Polish  ghettos  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">await </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">next </p>
<p class="calibre1">step.104 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heydrich's  memo,  entitled  "Evacuation  of  the  New  Eastern  Provinces," </p>
<p class="calibre1">decreed:  "The  evacuation  of  Poles  and  Jews  in  the  new  Eastern  Provinces </p>
<p class="calibre1">will  be  conducted  by  the  Security  Police  .  .  .  The  census  documents  provide </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  basis for the  evacuation.  All  persons  in  the  new provinces  possess  a  copy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  census  form  is  the  temporary  identification  card  giving  permission  to </p>
<p class="calibre1">stay.  Therefore,  all  persons  have  to  hand  over  the  card  before  deportation  ... </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  caught  without  this  card  is  subject  to  possible  execution....  It  is  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">jected that the census will take place on December 17, 1939."105 </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than a half-million people were to be deported from the Warthe </p>
<p class="calibre1">region alone, based on "Statistical information (census lists, etc.) from Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man and Polish sources, investigative results of the Security Police and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Security Service, and surveys ... [which would] constitute the foundation."106 </p>
<p class="calibre1">How long would it take to quantify and organize the deportation of </p>
<p class="calibre1">millions from various regions across Eastern Europe based upon a December </p>
<p class="calibre1">17 census? Relying upon the lightning speed of Hollerith machines, Hey- </p>
<p class="calibre1">drich was able to assert, "That means the large-scale evacuation can begin no </p>
<p class="calibre1">sooner than around January 1, 1940."107 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  the  late  December  census  took  place  over  several  days,  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">December  17  to  December  23,  1939.  Each  person  over  the  age  of  twelve  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  to  fill  out  census  and  registration  in  duplicate,  and  was  then  finger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">printed.  Part  of  the  form  was  stamped  and  returned  as  the  person's  new </p>
<p class="calibre1">identification  form.  Without  it,  they  would  be  shot.  With  it,  they  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre1">deported.108 </p>
<p class="calibre1">December was a busy month for IBM's German subsidiary—and </p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely  profitable.  Throughout  Germany  and  the  conquered  territories, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dehomag  frantically  tried  to  keep  up  with  the  pace  of  unending  censuses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">registrations,  and  analyses  of  people,  property,  and  military  operations  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">required  its  equipment,  repair  services,  and  card  processing.  Millions  of  cards </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  printed  each  week  just  to  meet  the  demand.  Understandably,  whereas </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rottke  had  been  incensed  at  Watson's  initial  refusal  to  transfer  the  alphabet- </p>
<p class="calibre1">izers as requested, all the hard feelings were now gone. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  early  1940,  IBM  Geneva  sent  Watson  a  statement  of  Dehomag's </p>
<p class="calibre1">1939  profits.  The  numbers  were  almost  double  the  previous  year,  total- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ing  RM  3,953,721  even  after  all  the  royalty  income  and  other  disguised </p>
<p class="calibre1">revenue.  The  Dehomag  profit  statement  to  Watson  also  explained  that  some- </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  strategic  alliance  with  Hitler  continued  to  pay  off  in  the  cities  and </p>

<p class="calibre1">along  the  railways  and  in  the  concentration  camps  of  Europe.  Soon  the  Jews </p>

<p class="calibre1">HITLER'S    ARMIES    SWARMED    OVER   EUROPE   THROUGHOUT </p>
<p class="calibre1">the first months of 1940. The forces of the Reich slaughtered all </p>
<p class="calibre1">opposition with a military machine unparalleled in human </p>
<p class="calibre1">history. Blitzkrieg—lightning war—was more than a new word. Its </p>
<p class="calibre1">very utterance signified coordinated death under the murderous </p>
<p class="calibre1">onslaught of Hitler's massive air, sea, and 100,000-troop ground </p>
<p class="calibre1">assaults. Nothing could stop Germany. </p>

<p class="calibre1">new </p>

<p class="calibre1">order—was </p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming </p>
<p class="calibre1">a </p>
<p class="calibre1">reality.  Austria:  annexed  in  March  1938.  Sudetenland:  seized  October </p>
<p class="calibre1">1938. Czechoslovakia: dismembered March 1939, and the Memel re- </p>
<p class="calibre1">gion ceded from Lithuania that same month. Poland: invaded Sep- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tember  1939.  By  January  1940,  nearly  42  million  people  had  come </p>
<p class="calibre1">under </p>
<p class="calibre1">brutal </p>
<p class="calibre1">German </p>
<p class="calibre1">subjugation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disease, </p>
<p class="calibre1">starvation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered </p>
<p class="calibre1">lives, and fear became the desolate truth across the Continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Jews  were  running  out  of  refuges.  One  overrun  sanctuary </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  another  slid  back  into  the  familiar  nightmare  of  registration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">confiscation,  and  ghettoization.  No  sooner  did  the  Swastika  flag  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation  unfurl,  than  the  anti-Semitic  decrees  rolled  out.  Eastern </p>
<p class="calibre1">European  countries  not  yet  conquered  emulated  the  pattern  as  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">man  sympathizers  and  surrogates  in  Romania,  Hungary,  and  Italy </p>
<p class="calibre1">undertook Berlin's bidding to destroy local Jewish populations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  winter  receded  the  Reich  prepared  for  further  agression.  By </p>
<p class="calibre1">spring  1940,  Nazi  Germany  began  dismembering  Scandinavia  and  the  Low </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countries.  April  9,  the  Wehrmacht  invaded  Denmark  and  Norway.  Several </p>
<p class="calibre1">days  later,  tiny  Luxembourg  was  taken.  May  15,  Germany  crushed  Holland </p>
<p class="calibre1">into  complete  submission.  May  28,  Belgium  capitulated  to  German  forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  April  and  May,  Germany's  enslavement  jurisdiction  grew  to  65  mil </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion Europeans.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cities  across  Europe  smoldered  in  ruin.  Warsaw  was  pulverized  into  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">shambles.  Rotterdam  was  mercilessly  bombed  even  after  its  surrender  on </p>
<p class="calibre1">May  14  because,  as  Berlin  propagandists  explained,  Dutch  officials  exceeded </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ultimatum  deadline  by  some  twenty  minutes.  An  elaborate  Nazi  newsreel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">filmed  by  parachuting  cameramen,  showed  Rotterdam  almost  completely </p>
<p class="calibre1">aflame.  Airports  at  Brussels  and  Antwerp  were  bombed  and  strafed  by  hun- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dreds of Luftwaffe planes.2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazi-commandeered  trains  crisscrossed  the  continent  hauling  into  Ger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  looted  coal,  scrap  metal,  foodstuffs,  machinery,  and  the  other  essentials </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berlin  craved.  "When  they  weren't  carrying  raw  materials,  or  transporting </p>
<p class="calibre1">troops,  the  railroad  cars  freighted  conscripted  labor  en  route  to  work  pro- </p>
<p class="calibre1">jects as well as expelled Jews destined for concentration camps.3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mass  executions,  organized  plunder,  and  ruthless  invasion—these  blared </p>
<p class="calibre1">across  the  front  pages  of  the  newspapers,  the  frames  of  newsreels,  and  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">broadcasts  of  radio  news.  Germany  was  portrayed  in  emotional  headlines </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  feature  articles  as  a  savage,  murderous  nation  bent  on  destroying  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">dominating  all  of  Europe  no  matter  how  many  people  died.  On  April  2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland's  exile  government  declared  that  in  addition  to  a  million  prisoners </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  forced  laborers  transported  to  German  work  sites,  an  estimated  2.5  mil- </p>
<p class="calibre1">lion  had  died  as  a  result  of  military  action,  executions,  starvation,  or  frigid </p>
<p class="calibre1">homelessness.  Headlines  continued  as  the  New  York  Times  grossly  exagger- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ated  the  five  days  of  Germany's  invasion  of  the  Netherlands  which  com- </p>
<p class="calibre1">menced  May  10;  the  newspaper  claimed  a  quarter  of  the  Dutch  army  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">killed-more than 100,000 (even though the number was 2,200).4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  millions  of  Jews  were  now  clearly  earmarked  for  death  by </p>
<p class="calibre1">virtue  of  Hitler's  oppressive  measures.  In  November  1939,  the  New  York </p>
<p class="calibre1">Times  published  reports  from  Paris  declaring  that  1.5  million  Jews  trapped  in </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland  were in  danger  of starving  to  death.  On January  21,  1940, World Jew- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ish  Congress  Chairman  Nahum  Goldmann  warned  a  Chicago  crowd  of  1,000, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  well  as  wire  service  reporters,  that  if  the  war  continued  for  another  year </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 million Polish Jews would die of calculated starvation or outright murder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  dire  predictions  only  capped  years  of  saturation  media  coverage  about </p>
<p class="calibre1">inhumane  Jewish  persecution  and  horrifying  concentration  camps.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  whenever  Jewish  persecution  was  reported,  the  media  invari- </p>
<p class="calibre1">ably  reported  the  incessant  registrations  and  censuses  as  Nazidom's  initial </p>
<p class="calibre1">step.  The  methodology,  technology,  and  the  connection  to  IBM  were  still  far </p>
<p class="calibre1">below  public  awareness.  But  some  specifics  were  beginning  to  appear.  For </p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  a  March  2,  1940,  New  York  Times  article,  entitled  "Jews  in  Cracow </p>
<p class="calibre1">Move  to  Ghettos,"  described  how  80,000  Jews  had  been  herded  into  over- </p>
<p class="calibre1">crowded  flats  in  a  squalid  urban  district  devoid  of  resources.  "A  common </p>
<p class="calibre1">sight,"  the  report  asserted,  "is  the  white  armband  with  the  blue  Star  of  David, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  all  Jews  must  wear  by  government  decree  .  .  .  [signifying]  their  regis- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tration </p>
<p class="calibre1">in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the </p>
<p class="calibre1">government </p>
<p class="calibre1">card </p>
<p class="calibre1">file."6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  with  great  caution  could  Watson  now  publicly  defend  the  Hitler </p>
<p class="calibre1">agenda,  even  through  euphemisms  and  code  words.  Most  Americans  would </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  tolerate  anyone  who  even  appeared  to  be  a  Nazi  sympathizer  or  collabo- </p>
<p class="calibre1">rator.  So,  as  he  had  done  since  Kristallnacht  in  late  1938,  Watson  continued </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  insert  corporate  distance  between  himself  and  all  involvement  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">affairs  of  his  subsidiaries  in  Nazi  Europe—even  as  he  micro-managed  their </p>
<p class="calibre1">day-to-day  operations.  More  than  ever,  he  now  channeled  his  communica- </p>
<p class="calibre1">tions  to  Nazi  Europe  through  trusted  intermediaries  in  Geneva  and  else- </p>
<p class="calibre1">where    on    the    Continent.    He    controlled    subsidiary  operations    through </p>
<p class="calibre1">attorneys  and  employees  acting  as  nominee  owners,  following  the  pattern  set </p>
<p class="calibre1">in Czechoslovakia and Poland.7 </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  May  1940,  as  American  society  prepared  for  an  inevitable  war  with </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler,  Watson  worked  to  secure  the  underpinnings  of  his  public  image.  He </p>
<p class="calibre1">intensified his advocacy for peace, and against all war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Universal  peace  is  one  of  the  most  desirable,  most  worthwhile  ideals </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  world  today,"  Watson  insisted  in  a  May  4  speech  to  reporters.  "It  can- </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  be  sold  by  a  few  people  working  in  widely  scattered  communities.  The </p>
<p class="calibre1">project  requires  a  worldwide  organization  of  enthusiastic,  hard-working  in- </p>
<p class="calibre1">dividuals  selling  the  gospel  of  peace."8  Watson  advertised  IBM  as  such  an </p>
<p class="calibre1">organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four  days  later,  on  May  8,  Watson  told  reporters  that  the  company's  lat- </p>
<p class="calibre1">est  course  held  in  Endicott,  New  York,  for  IBM  sales  representatives  from </p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-four  countries  was  to  "enable  the  students  ...  to  make  greater  contri- </p>
